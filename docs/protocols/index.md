Hummingbot features connectors to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on various blockchain protocols.

Trading on protocols generally require you to connect a **wallet** which gives Hummingbot access to your token balances and enables Hummingbot to automate transactions. In addition, you need to configure access to **node** in order to send and receive blockchain data.

Below are the currently supported protocols in Hummingbot:

* [Celo](./celo)
* [Terra](./terra)

## Hummingbot Gateway V2

Starting from Hummingbot v1.3.0, Hummingbot comes built-in with Gateway V2 middleware. Gateway V2 can be started from within Hummingbot, and gives Hummingbot access to various decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap V2 and Pangolin.

See the [Gateway V2](./gateway.md) page for more information.
