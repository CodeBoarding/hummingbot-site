## Intro

**Get trading fee rebates when you support the Hummingbot Foundation!** 

Thank you for your support for the Hummingbot codebase! We’d love to have you all support us by creating exchange accounts using our referral codes, or if you're a developer, adding our brokerID to your custom bots.  

This supports our work at the not-for-profit Hummingbot Foundation and **provides you with increased fee share rebates as well!** Hummingbot Foundation makes money through exchange broker programs, in which we partner with exchanges such as through [Binance’s broker program](https://www.binance.com/en/broker) that share a portion of the trading fees you pay with us, at zero cost to you.

## Why should you support us?

Hummingbot is different from other trading bots: 

1. **Open Source:** Our mission is democratize high-frequency trading (HFT) and make sophisticated trading tools and algorithms accessible to everyone in the world! In order to achieve this mission, we’ve decided to make our exchange connectors and strategies open source so that any one can benefit from and contribute to the codebase. 
2. **Free:** To keep keep Hummingbot open source and free, we have fee share agreements with exchange partners, in which the exchanges share a portion of the trading fees, without bearing any additional fees from the user.
3. **Community Owned:** Hummingbot Foundation is community owned, where the community can create proposals and vote through HBOT. Excess Funds are held in treasury and can be allocated via voting towards dev grants, token buybacks, or other initiatives that the community proposes. Feel free to learn more about how [Governance](/governance/) and [HBOT proposals & voting](/governance/proposals) works!

### Get increased fee rebates

Certain exchanges such as [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) and [OKX](https://www.okx.com/) allow their broker partners to allocate a certain percentage of their fee share to users.  For exchanges that allow for this, we already allocate 10% (25% of our total fee share) to users as an additional incentive to add the Hummingbot brokerID. This means that any users who sign up using our referral link and/or use Hummingbot will get an additional 10% off their trading fees!

Our revenues, which we report to the community every month (see [Reporting](https://hummingbot.org/reporting/)) lets us maintain a full-time, globally dstributed team of engineers, quality assurance analysts, community managers, and others who support the community. If

### Dev grants in stablecoins, not HBOT

Currently, all developer grants are in HBOT tokens since our reenuves not quite covering operational costs, but close to breakeven. After we are cashflow positive, we plan to 
propose that a certain percentage of our fees be directed toward developer grants. This would allow developers to earn stablecoins rather than HBOT for:

- Fixing bugs
- Adding new exchange connectors
- Adding and improving strategies

### Future community initiatives

Hummingbot Foundation’s mission also includes **educating everyone on how to master high-frequency trading (HFT)** because we believe its the best way to help everyone achieve financial freedom! 

For example, we are launching a free developer bootcamp ([Hummingbot Botcamp](http://www.hummingbot.thinkific.com)) to teach everyone how to create their own trading bots with Hummingbot.

More resources means that we can create more program like this, as well as supporting the community in creating other tools and resources like [trader sharing sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eB_66K0JxgM&t=351s), [TradingView integrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZeCQNJmLy8), and [StreamLit dashboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6PWbN2pDK8).

Future initiatives may include a [user-generated strategies marketplace](https://hummingbot.discourse.group/t/idea-earning-hbot-with-user-generated-strategies/18/5), and [trading competitions](https://hummingbot.discourse.group/t/idea-featured-exchange-monthly-trading-competitions/17)!

It just takes less then 10 minutes to set this up, and you’ll be able to support us and our mission. The future of our roadmap depends on you all.
