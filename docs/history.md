Hummingbot was built and open-sourced by CoinAlpha, Inc,  a startup based in Mountain View, California. CoinAlpha is backed by [Initialized Capital](https://initialized.com/), [Bain Capital Ventures](https://www.baincapitalventures.com/), [Defiance Capital](https://www.defiance.capital/), and other leading crypto and fintech investors.

CoinAlpha runs businesses that support the Hummingbot ecosystem, such as:

* [Hummingbot Miner](https://miner.hummingbot.io): a "liquidity mining" platform where Hummingbot users can run market making bots on centralized exchanges to earn token rewards from token issuers who seek a decentralized, community-based alternative to hiring market makers for liquidity services
* [Hummingbot Pro](/developers/architecture/#hummingbot-pro-preview): a forthcoming module that combines a Cython-based backtesting engine plugin, access to historical order book data, and associated services/support aimed at professional and institutional Hummingbot users.

In October 2021, CoinAlpha announced plans to launch the Hummingbot Foundation, a new open source foundation that maintains the Hummingbot Github repository and administers a decentralized, community-driven system of software development.
