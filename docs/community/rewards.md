Reward programs and trading competitions are initiatives created by exchanges, protocols, or other organizations that incentivize algorithmic trading using Hummingbot. These programs typically offer rewards to traders who provide liquidity, maintain active trading volumes, or otherwise contribute to market health on their platforms.

This page lists third-party programs and trading competitions that utilize Hummingbot. While these programs leverage Hummingbot's technology, they are independently managed by their respective organizations, with their own terms, conditions, and reward structures.
