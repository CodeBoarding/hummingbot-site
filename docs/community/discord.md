### Program Rules

In the recently approved  governance proposal, HBOT holders approved the continuation of the Discord Support Program for 2024, allocating a **100,000 HBOT budget per week** to be used to reward users who provide quality answers to questions other users ask on Discord.

* 2024 Weekly Payout: 100,000 HBOT (See [HGP-50](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0xc13f3b9fdaded22d1ce0b5528c9146fb2a762c41deed88e6c64e798465414738))
* Maximum Reward Percentage: Each contributor may earn a maximum of 10% of each weekly payout

### Evaluation Process

Discord users with the **`support-evaluator`** role may add a 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£ or 3Ô∏è‚É£ emoji to answers and threads provided by users who have the **`support-contributor`** badge. Each thread or set of messages is scored, so that a single conversation with a user is treated as an single answer, which is assigned 1, 2, or 3 points.

  * 1Ô∏è‚É£: 1 point for a basic answer
  * 2Ô∏è‚É£: 2 points for answers concerning V2 Strategies, Dashboard, and other new/advanced Hummingbot features
  * 3Ô∏è‚É£: 3 points for going the extra mile in assisting users and hand-holding them through their issues via in a Discord thread.

Currently, the Foundation team manually tracks evaluated responses in the [Discord Support Program Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mI1evL-_BNbQtLL_gvblPJoYmnOm4zV0prSgo-7Klz8/edit?usp=sharing) and computes the weekly rewards earned by each support provider. We plan to automate this process in the future.

On a monthly basis, Hummingbot Foundation processes bounty payouts and pays bounties to users' Ethereum wallets.

Starting in August 2024, by default, contributors will receive their total bounties earned in HBOT. Contributors may elect to receive their bounties paid in USDC for a 10% fee by filing an updated [New Contributor Form](https://forms.gle/uyvPhQuTn4or4fm1A).
