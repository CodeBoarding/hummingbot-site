Botcamp is the official training and membership program for the Hummingbot community. It is a paid online course offered by Hummingbot Foundation that teaches you both the **theory and practice of algo trading**.

Members learn how to design and run strategies such as market making, arbitrage, and directional strategies. Afterwards, they can create their own custom trading strategy as a Hummingbot script. Many of the [sample scripts](/scripts/examples) were built by Botcamp members.

Members get access to the full library of Botcamp content modules along with a monthly live session teaches you how to use the newest features in Hummingbot. In addition, you get individualized 1-on-1 coaching from mentors, hands-on support from our staff in installing and using Hummingbot, and private channels to network with other members.

Each quarterly, we organize a Demo Day for Botcamp members to showcase the custom strategies that they have built. Here are two recent examples:
