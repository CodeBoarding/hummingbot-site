## Certification Process

Overseen by the core maintainers of the Hummingbot codebase, the Hummingbot certification process is designed to be comprehensive and challenging, ensuring that participants have the skills to code and operate custom algo trading strategies.

The process is centered around completing a [Hummingbot Botcamp](https://www.botcamp.xyz) cohort, which includes two main requirements and one optional requirement:

### 1. Build a Custom Strategy with Hummingbot

While each certification may have different requirements, developers are generally expected to design, code, run, and present a custom algorithmic trading strategy.

This task requires a deep understanding of trading principles, coding proficiency, and the ability to implement and test strategies in a real-world environment. The goal is to create a rigorous process that showcases the participant's technical and analytical skills.

### 2. Pass Review by Hummingbot Maintainers

After completing their trading strategy, participants submit their strategy code and a brief video explaining the strategy thesis and showing it in action.

Their work will be evaluate by Hummingbot maintainers based on the following criteria:

- **Originality:** Uniqueness of the trading strategy
- **Technical:** The quality of implementationa and use of Hummingbot framework components
- **Effort:** Overall thoroughness and effort invested

### 3. Present at Demo Day (NFT)

While we accept submissions after a cohort ends to allow participants to attain certification in their own time, we highly encourage Botcamp participants to complete and present their strategies at Demo Day, the capstone event for each cohort.

Watch their strategy presentations from past Demo Days on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAulqoSenmk&list=PLDwlNkL_4MMctOkqVHECwqw0rP885FzMy&index=1) to see the innovative trading strategies designed and coded by Hummingbot Certified Developers.

Each individual or team member who presents a strategy during Demo Day can claim a limited edition **Botcamp Cohort NFT**, commemorating the hard work and the unique bonds formed within the cohort members.

To receive a Cohort NFT, you must submit and present your strategy at your cohort's Demo Day.

**Cohort MVS (1/1)**

In addition to the individual NFTs, a special **Most Valuable Strategy NFT** will be awarded to the top strategy as voted by the cohort participants. This unique NFT recognizes the standout project of the cohort, highlighting the exceptional skills and innovation of its creator.
