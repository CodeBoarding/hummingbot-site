Hummingbot allowed me to launch a successful suite of trading strategies managing over $2 billion in trade volume. From the outset, the design of Hummingbot made it easy to access data and execute orders reliably and with low latency, allowing me to place my attention on the strategy and have the heavy lifting done on the backend. I can't recommend Hummingbot enough for any algo trader seeking a 0 to 1 platform.

Since 2021, I've been a dedicated user of Hummingbot, primarily utilizing the pure market making strategy. Based on my profitable strategies, I started an algo-trading startup in Saudi Arabia with a colleague from Tower Research. Our combined expertise is now channeled towards crafting custom strategies, and we're proudly doing so on top of the robust foundation of the Hummingbot open-source software.
