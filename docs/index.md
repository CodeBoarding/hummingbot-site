# Community-owned software for building crypto trading bots

Welcome to the official website for the Hummingbot Foundation and documentation site for Hummingbot.

Hummingbot is software that helps you build and run automated trading strategies, or **bots**. Its codebase is free and publicly available on Github under the Apache 2.0 open source license.

Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation that facilitates decentralized maintenance and governance of the Hummingbot codebase, powered by the Hummingbot Governance Token (HBOT).

Help us **democratize high-frequency trading** and give sophisticated algorithms to everyone in the world!
