## Purpose

From [14+ agreements](/maintenance/agreements/) with exchanges that rebate fees based on user trading activity along their respective connectors, **the Foundation is cashflow positive from inception** and expects that this margin will increase as more individuals and professionals use Hummingbot. Any excess proceeds are held in the Foundation treasury.

**The sole use case of the HBOT token is community governance.** HBOT tokens empower holders to govern many aspects of the Hummingbot Foundation, including approving all changes to the Hummingbot codebase, electing Board of Directors, and allocating HBOT community distributions and other assets in the Foundation treasury.

**The Foundation will never sell or issue more HBOT tokens.** 100% of the HBOT token supply will be distributed to past stakeholders, future contributors, developers, and users.

## Community Distributions

At Foundation inception, 4 million (4% of total HBOT supply) was distributed to 62 historical Github contributors to the Hummingbot codebase and 2,522 historical users of the Hummingbot Miner platform.

The remaining 36 million HBOT tokens outstanding (36% of total HBOT supply) will be distributed during the first 4 years after Foundation inception.

| Year  | % of Total Supply | Tokens |
|-------|-------:|-----------------:|
| 2022  |   9.0% |     90,000,000   |
| 2023  |   9.0% |     90,000,000   |
| 2024  |   9.0% |     90,000,000   |
| 2025  |   9.0% |     90,000,000   |

The Foundation aims to distribute these tokens to:

* Users who utilize Hummingbot software to provide liquidity to Hummingbot-connected [exchanges](/exchanges) and decentralized market making platforms;
* Developers who improve and extend the Hummingbot codebase;
* Community members who create content, update documentation, and perform other work that benefit the Hummingbot ecosystem.

## Voting Your Tokens

See [Governance](/governance) for information about how to vote using your HBOT token balance (no gas required!) and participate in deciding the future of Hummingbot.

## Delegation

Token holders may delegate their votes to other members of the Hummingbot community by enabling delegation at [Snapshot Delegation](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate).

In order to limit delegation to the HBOT tokens and Hummingbot Foundation matters (and exclude delegation for other owned tokens that also vote on snapshot), enter `hbot.eth` in the space field. Otherwise, leave blank to delegate all tokens.

If a user has delegated their tokens, they can still override any delegation by directly voting their tokens. Voting outright always overrides any delegation. Note that, as the Hummingbot Foundation becomes firmly established and community participation increases, token holders in the future may choose to propose to disable voting by delegation, thereby allocating greater voting power toward community members who vote outright only.
