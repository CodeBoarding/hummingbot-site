## Purpose

**The sole use case of the HBOT token is community governance.** HBOT tokens empower holders to govern many aspects of the Hummingbot Foundation, including approving all changes to the Hummingbot codebase, electing Board of Directors, and allocating HBOT community distributions and other assets in the Foundation treasury.

**Hummingbot Foundation has never sold HBOT tokens, and it will never sell or issue more HBOT tokens.** The total supply of HBOT is fixed at 1,000,000,000 tokens, and all of the supply will be distributed to past stakeholders, future contributors, developers, and users. 

Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit foundation that earns revenues from exchange partnerships that rebate fees based on user trading activity through connectors; any excess profits above operating costs will be held in treasury, to be allocated by HBOT token holders.
