## Overview

In 2019, Hummingbot was introduced as a command-line based market-making bot.

Now, we are excited to introduce [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), an open-source graphical interface designed to help users deploy and manage multiple Hummingbot instances efficiently. Not only does Dashboard simplify the process of managing bots at scale, but it also is designed to be compatible with [V2 Strategies](../v2-strategies/index.md), which users can use Dashboard to create and backtest before deploying live.

* **Accessible Framework**: Uses the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) open source data visualization framework
* **Backtestable Strategies**: Helps users configure and backtest [Strategy Controllers](../v2-strategies/controllers/)
* **Multi-Bot Deployment**: Deploy and manage mulitiple bot instances and monitor their real-time performance
