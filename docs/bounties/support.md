## Community Incentives Program

We believe in the power of our community! To inspire our members to engage, collaborate, and help each other, we have launched a unique **Community Incentives Program**. Our goal is to promote a thriving community where everyone is motivated to share knowledge, solve problems, and collectively grow.

### Program Overview

The initiative aims to reward community members who share knowledge, answer questions, and contribute valuable insights about Hummingbot. Each quality interaction is a chance to earn **HBOT rewards**! Learn more in our [blog post](https://blog.hummingbot.org/community-incentives-update/).
