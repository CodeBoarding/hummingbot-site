!!! tip "Pay in HBOT for a 1/2 fees!"
    Sponsors may fund bounties in HBOT to receive a 50% reduction in the handling fee (10%).

## Bounty Handling Fee

Hummingbot Foundation charges Sponsors a Handling Fee for overseeing the entire lifecycle of a bounty: scoping the bounty, finding and assigning the bounty to a qualified contributor, performing engineering/QA review, and conducting payments. This saves you a lot of time and effort.

The standard Handling Fee is **20%**. If a Sponsor submits a 1000 USDT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 200 USDT and the Contributor receives 800 USDT.

If the bounty is denominated in [HBOT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5097d9baeafb89f9bcb78c9290d545db5f9e9cb), the Handling Fee is **10%**. If a Sponsor submits a 100,000 HBOT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 10,000 HBOT and the Contributor receives 90,000 HBOT.

## Payment Process

Contributors are paid only after the bounty fix has been verified and published. Afterwards, Foundation will include the bounty payment in its monthly bounty payout process and mark the bounty as Paid in both [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7/views/1) and [HBOT Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNAumPMnXfsghAAXrfKkPGRH9QlC8k7Cu1FGQVL1t0M/edit?usp=sharing).
