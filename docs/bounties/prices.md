!!! tip
    Sponsor pricing may be lower if sponsors pay using HBOT

## Bounty Handling Fee

Hummingbot Foundation charges Sponsors a Handling Fee for overseeing the entire lifecycle of a bounty: scoping the bounty, finding and assigning the bounty to a qualified contributor, performing engineering/QA review, and conducting payments. This saves you a lot of time and effort.

The standard Handling Fee is **20%**. If a Sponsor submits a 1000 USDT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 200 USDT and the Contributor receives 800 USDT.

If the bounty is denominated in [HBOT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xe5097d9baeafb89f9bcb78c9290d545db5f9e9cb), the Handling Fee is **10%**. If a Sponsor submits a 100,000 HBOT total bounty, the Handling Fee is 10,000 HBOT and the Contributor receives 90,000 HBOT.

## Payment Process

After the bounty fix has been verified and published, we schedule the bounty for payment, and the Foundation will include the bounty payment in its monthly bounty payout process. 

Afterwards, we will mark the bounty as Paid in both [Bounties Board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7/views/1) and [HBOT Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNAumPMnXfsghAAXrfKkPGRH9QlC8k7Cu1FGQVL1t0M/edit?usp=sharing).

## Pricing Considerations

Starting prices are subject to team discussion considering:
- Task scope feasibility within suggested bounty amount
- Developer's experience for the task
- Current HBOT token price or equivalent in different tokens
    
!!! note
    All decisions regarding priority, voting, and pricing are subject to team consensus and may be revised based on project needs and market conditions.*
