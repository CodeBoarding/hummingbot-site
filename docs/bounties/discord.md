The **Discord Support Program** fosters active community engagement by enabling members to collaborate and contribute to issue resolution. This initiative invites participation from non-developers and traders, allowing more people to gain a sense of ownership while being rewarded for their involvement in sustaining a vibrant, responsive support ecosystem within our Discord channels.

We encourage you to check out the [**blog post**](../blog/posts/improvements-to-discord-support-bounties/index.md) for an in-depth explanation of program perks and participation guidelines.

We welcome you to officially join this community effort by completing the [**AML Policy Form**](https://forms.gle/9jcm45HvU2XsBsm49)
