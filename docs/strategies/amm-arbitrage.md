# `amm_arb`

## 📁 [Strategy folder](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/hummingbot/strategy/amm_arb)

## 📝 Summary

This strategy monitors prices between a trading pair on an `amm` exchange versus another trading pair on another `spot` or `amm` exchange in order to identify arbitrage opportunities. Similar to the `arbitrage` strategy, it executes offsetting buy and sell orders in both markets in order to capture arbitrage opportunities with profitability higher than `min_profitability`, net of transaction costs, which include both blockchain transaction fees (gas) and exchange fees.

Hummingbot will be accessing `amm` exchanges via Gateway V2 from v1.4.0. If you are looking for instructions on how to configure `amm` exchanges, refer to the [Gateway V2](/protocols/gateway/) and the [`amm`](/exchanges/#amm) specific setup instructions.

## 🏦 Exchanges supported

* [`amm` exchanges](/exchanges/#amm)
* [`spot` exchanges](/exchanges/#spot)

## 👷 Maintenance

* Release added: [0.34.0](/release-notes/0.34.0/) by CoinAlpha
