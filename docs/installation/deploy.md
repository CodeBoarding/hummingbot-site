Watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzmJuJ0D0c8) that accompanies this page, or the individual breakpoints that correspond to each section below.

## `deploy-examples` repo

The [deploy-examples](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples) repository provides various examples of how to deploy Hummingbot using Docker.

Clone the `deploy-examples` repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples
```

Make sure to carefully go over the README files in each sub-folder in the repo, which contain instructions on how to use them.

## Bash Scripts

The scripts located in the [/bash_scripts](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/bash_scripts) directory help you install Hummingbot and Hummingbot Gateway using Docker.

Here's the section in the video that shows you how to use them:

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzmJuJ0D0c8?start=142" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Read the [README](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/bash_scripts) to understand how to use each script:

- `hummingbot-create.sh`: Create and start an instance of Hummingbot
- `hummingbot-start.sh`: Connect to a previously-created instance of Hummingbot
- `hummingbot-update.sh`: Updates your instance to the latest version of Hummingbot
- `hummingbot-update.sh`: Updates your instance to the latest version of Hummingbot
- `gateway-create.sh`: Create and start an instance of Hummingbot Gateway
- `gateway-copy-certs.sh`: Copy the SSL certificates generated by Hummingbot into your Gateway files certs folder

Each script assumes that [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) has already been installed. They also assume that the user has Docker permissions without requiring `sudo` and permissions to run the files with `.sh` extension. If not, then open a terminal within the folder that contains the scripts and then run the following commands:

```
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
chmod a+x *.sh
```

## Docker Compose Deployments

The examples below use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to install Hummingbot.  Make sure you have it installed beforehand.

Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multiple Docker containers as a single application. With Docker Compose, you can define the settings for each container in a YAML file, like the image to use, the ports to expose, and any environment variables or volumes that should be attached.

Once you've defined your configuration file, you can use the `docker-compose up` command to start all of the containers in the application.

### Apple M1 and other ARM machines

By default, the examples below use the `hummingbot/hummingbot:latest` and `hummingbot/gateway:latest` images to create the containers.

If you are using a machine with an ARM processor, like a Mac with an Apple M1 or M2 chip, we recommend that you build a local Hummingbot image instead by cloning the [official repository](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) and running the command:

```
docker build -f Dockerfile.arm -t hummingbot/hummingbot:arm .
```

Once the image has been built, then replace `hummingbot/hummingbot:latest` with `hummingbot/hummingbot:arm` instead in the yml files

### Simple Hummingbot Compose

This configuration deploys a single instance of Hummingbot. Here's the relevant section in the video:

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzmJuJ0D0c8?start=447" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` file used:

```yml linenums="1"
version: "3.9"
services:
  bot:
    container_name: hummingbot_instance
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: 5
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
```

!!! note "How does the `docker-compose.yml file` work?"
    By default, this will pull the `latest` Docker image of Hummingbot as an instance named `hummingbot_instance`. You can change the image to `hummingbot/hummingbot:development` or another tag if needed.

    The service then creates volumes mounted for storing configuration files, logs, data, scripts, and certificates. Docker will automatically create the volumes if they don't already exist. If you already have existing folders you would like to use then you can change the volumes path instead to the correct path to the folders that has the existing config files.

    The `logging` section specifies that logs should be saved as JSON files with a maximum size of 10 megabytes and a maximum of 5 files. The `tty` and `stdin_open` settings enable the service to be run in interactive mode, and the `network_mode` is set to "host" so that the container can access the host network. 

In Bash/Terminal, go to the folder where you have the `docker-compose.yml` file and then run the following command:

```
docker compose up -d

```

The Docker instance should now be running in the background. To attach to the instance, run:

```
docker attach hummingbot_instance
```

To exit the instance but keep it running in the background press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd> P </kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd> Q </kbd>

To stop the instance, run the command:

```
docker compose down
```

See the [README](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/simple_hummingbot_compose) for more information.

### Autostart Hummingbot Compose

This configuration deploys a Hummingbot instance that automatically starts running a pre-configured script or strategy. Here's the relevant section in the video:

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzmJuJ0D0c8?start=572" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This `docker-compose.yml` file adds the highlighted lines below:

```yml linenums="1" hl_lines="14 15 16"
version: "3.9"
services:
  bot:
    container_name: hummingbot_instance
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    environment:
      - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
      - CONFIG_FILE_NAME=format_status.py
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: 5
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
```

Replace the `CONFIG_PASSWORD` with your [Hummingbot password](/operation/password/), and replace `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` with either a strategy  config file (that ends in `.yml`) or a script file (that ends in `.py`).

If you are auto-starting a strategy make sure you have the  strategy config `(.yml)` file in the proper folder `hummingbot_files/conf/strategies`. For a script, make sure you have the `(.py)` file under the `hummingbot_files/scripts` folder.

Read the [README](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/autostart_hummingbot_compose) in the folder  to learn how to use this configuration in more detail.


### Hummingbot Gateway Compose

This configuration deploys a Hummingbot instance linked to a Hummingbot Gateway instance that helps it connect to DEXs.Here's the relevant section in the video:

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzmJuJ0D0c8?start=895" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This `docker-compose.yml` file adds the highlighted lines below:

```yml linenums="1" hl_lines="22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33"
version: "3.9"
services:
  bot:
    container_name: hummingbot_instance
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: 5
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
  gateway:
    container_name: hummingbot_gateway
    image: hummingbot/gateway:latest
    ports:
      - "15888:15888"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./gateway_files/conf:/usr/src/app/conf"
      - "./gateway_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/usr/src/app/certs"
    environment:
      - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

Read the [README](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/hummingbot_gateway_compose) in the folder  to learn how to use this configuration in more detail.

To link Gateway to Hummingbot, you need to generate certificate files in the Hummingbot instance with the following command:
    
```
gateway generate-certs
```

Afterwards, ensure that the `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` and the certs file location under `volumes` match the passphrase you used to generate certs and the certs folder location, respectively.

    
If you run into a permissions error creating the certs then you may need to grant permissions to the Gateway conf and Hummingbot certs folder. You can use the following commands below to adjust the permissions

```
chmod a+rw hummingbot_files/certs
chmod a+rw gateway_files/conf
chmod a+rw gateway_files/logs
```
  
Run the following command to attach to the Hummingbot instance

```
docker attach hummingbot_instance
```

To attach to the Gateway instance run:
  
```
docker attach hummingbot_gateway
```

### Multiple Hummingbot Instances

You can deploy multiple Hummingbot instances using Docker Compose. Simply duplicate lines 3-20 of the [Simple Hummingbot Compose](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples/tree/main/simple_hummingbot_compose) file to create a new bot. 

Multiple bots can use the same folders but it's recommended to have separate folders for each bot so they have individual configs as well. You can add as many bots as needed. Change "bot" to "bot2" and the `container_name` to `hummingbot_instance2` or whatever name you prefer for the instance. If you want the bots to have separate folders then change `hummingbot_files` to `hummingbot_files2` under volumes. Repeat these steps depending on how many bots you need.

Your `docker-compose.yml` file should now look like this:

```yml linenums="1" hl_lines="22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40"
version: "3.9"
services:
  bot:
    container_name: hummingbot_instance
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: 5
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
  bot2:
    container_name: hummingbot_instance2
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: 5
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
```
