## Prerequisites

Supported versions:

* macOS 10 (Sierra) or later
* Intel x86
* Apple M1 / M2

### XCode Command Line Tools

[Xcode Command Line Tools](https://mac.install.guide/commandlinetools/index.html) are required. You can run the following command from Terminal to install them:

```
âžœ xcode-select --install
```

### Miniconda / Anaconda

!!! warning "Don't use Homebrew!"
    We don't recommend installing `conda` through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as this may cause issues during installation. Instead, downloading the installer directly from the Anaconda website. 

Hummingbot requires Python 3 and other libraries. To manage these dependencies, Hummingbot uses `conda`, an open source environment manager for Python. You can install `conda` using either Miniconda or Anaconda. 

Download the installer for your environment and run it:

* [Miniconda installer for MacOS](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links)
* [Anaconda installer for MacOS](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

MacOS with Intel x86:
```
curl -o Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

MacOS with Apple M1:
```
curl -o Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```

Follow the prompts on the installer screens. If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.

To make the changes take effect, close and then re-open your terminal window.

## Install Hummingbot

After you have installed the dependencies, follow the steps below to install Hummingbot from source:


```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
./install
conda activate hummingbot
./compile
```

!!! note
     The `conda activate hummingbot` command should add a `(hummingbot)` label in front of your command line, which lets you know that you are inside the conda environment. If not, check if conda was installed correctly and reinstall if necessary. 


## Launch Hummingbot

From inside the conda environment, run the following command to launch Hummingbot:
```
./start
```

You should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

To get started with Hummingbot, check out the following docs:

* [Post Installation](./post-installation.md)
* [Basic Features](../client/index.md)
* [Quickstart Guide](../academy-content/posts/quickstart-deploy-examples/0-index.md)
* [Hummingbot FAQ](../faq.md)

If you need to run DEX bots, install [Hummingbot Gateway](../gateway/index.md).

## Other Useful Commands


### Update Hummingbot to latest `master` release
```
git pull origin master
```

### Update Hummingbot to `development` branch
```
git pull origin development
```

### Removed compiled files
```
./clean
```

### Remove hummingbot conda environment
```
./uninstall
```

### `conda` command and ZSH

If the `conda` command is not available in your path, this may be because you are using [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) or another shell. 

To fix this, copy the code snippet below to your `.zshrc` or similar file. By default, Anaconda only adds it to your `.bash_profile` file, which makes the `conda` command available in your root path.

Use an IDE to edit the `.zshrc` file, and copy and paste the following code to the bottom of the file:

```bash
__conda_setup="$(CONDA_REPORT_ERRORS=false '/anaconda3/bin/conda' shell.bash hook 2> /dev/null)"
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    \eval "$__conda_setup"
else
    if [ -f "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
        . "/anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        CONDA_CHANGEPS1=false conda activate base
    else
        \export PATH="/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
    fi
fi
unset __conda_setup
```

Save the changes, and run the `conda init` command to initialize them:
```bash
conda init zsh
```
Afterward, you should be able to access the `conda` command from your path.
