We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if you want the simplest, easiest installation method and don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase.

## Prerequisites

Hummingbot runs on commodity hardware and does not require much memory or storage.

* **Operating System**: MacOS 10.12.6+ / Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+) / Windows 10+
* **Memory**: 4 GB RAM per instance
* **Storage**: 5 GB HDD space per instance

## Installation Process

### 1. Install Docker Compose

Hummingbot uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

!!! note "For Windows users"
    To install Docker on Windows, [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is needed. Follow [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL2 on your Windows system. Afterwards, proceed to the instructions above to install Docker Compose.

The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.


After installing Docker Desktop, verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
docker compose version
```

The output should be: `Docker Compose version v2.17.2` or similar. 

!!! warning
    Ensure that you are using Docker Compose V2, since Compose V1 is deprecated and the examples assume that you are using Compose V2.

### 2. Clone Repo

Enter the following commands in Bash/Terminal to clone the Hummingbot Github repo and enter the root folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
```

### 3. Pull Image

The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root folder provides a basic configuration for launching an instance.

```yaml
services:
  hummingbot:
    container_name: hummingbot
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/home/hummingbot/conf
      - ./conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors
      - ./conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies
      - ./conf/controllers:/home/hummingbot/conf/controllers
      - ./conf/scripts:/home/hummingbot/conf/scripts
      - ./logs:/home/hummingbot/logs
      - ./data:/home/hummingbot/data
      - ./certs:/home/hummingbot/certs
      - ./scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts
      - ./controllers:/home/hummingbot/controllers
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
    #  environment:
    #    - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
    #    - CONFIG_FILE_NAME=simple_pmm_example.py
    #    - SCRIPT_CONFIG=conf_simple_pmm_example.yaml
```

You will be able to modify this file and uncomment lines in order to automatically enter your pasword and start strategies. For now, we can use it as-is. 

Run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:

```bash
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container hummingbot  Started 
```

### 4. Attach to Instance

The `-d` flag runs Hummingbot in detached mode. Attach to it by running the command:

```bash
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should now see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

To get started with Hummingbot, check out the following pages and guides:

* [Basic Features](/client/)
* [V2 Strategy Walkthough](/v2-strategies/walkthrough/)
* [Hummingbot FAQ](/faq/)

## Advanced Configurations

### Autostart Strategy

This configures a Hummingbot instance to automatically start a script or strategy when the Docker instance is instantiated.

Uncomment the following lines in the [Docker Compose YML file](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L27C5-L30C54):

```yaml
  environment:
    - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a       # Replace "a" with your Hummingbot password
    - CONFIG_FILE_NAME=simple_pmm_example.py    # Replace with your script filename
    - SCRIPT_CONFIG=conf_simple_pmm_example.yaml   # Replace with your script config file (or leave commented)
```

Afterwards, stop the instance with `docker compose down` and re-launch it with `docker compose up -d`. When you attach to the instance, your strategy should already be running.

### Multiple Hummingbot Instances

This configuration launches two Hummingbot Docker instances with the container names `hummingbot-1` and `hummingbot-2`. To use it, replace the content of the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in your Hummingbot root folder with the code below.

If you add more instances, make sure to set `container_name` to something unique.

```bash
services:
  hummingbot-1:
    container_name: hummingbot-1
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/home/hummingbot/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/home/hummingbot/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/home/hummingbot/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/hummingbot/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=[password]
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host

  hummingbot-2:
    container_name: hummingbot-2
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/home/hummingbot/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/home/hummingbot/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/home/hummingbot/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/hummingbot/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=[password]
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
```

Note that the above configuration has both bots sharing the **hummingbot_files** folder, which is where configs, logs, and databases are stored. If you want to set a different folder for `hummingbot-2`, set `volumes` to a different folder path, such as **hummingbot_files_2**. 

Attach to instance 1:
```bash
docker attach hummingbot-1
``` 

Attach to instance 2:

```bash
docker attach hummingbot-2
```

### Hummingbot + Gateway + Broker Compose Example

This configuration starts instances of Hummingbot, [Gateway](/gateway/), and [EMQX Broker](/installation/broker/). To use it, replace the content of the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in your Hummingbot root folder with the code below.


```bash
services:
  hummingbot:
    container_name: "hummingbot"
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=[password]
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host

  gateway:
    container_name: "gateway"
    image: hummingbot/gateway:latest
    ports:
      - "15888:15888"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./gateway_files/conf:/usr/src/app/conf"
      - "./gateway_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/gateway/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=[passphrase]

  emqx:
    container_name: "emqx"
    image: emqx:5
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMQX_NAME=emqx
      - EMQX_LOADED_PLUGINS="emqx_recon,emqx_retainer,emqx_management,emqx_dashboard"
    volumes:
      - emqx-data:/opt/emqx/data
      - emqx-log:/opt/emqx/log
      - emqx-etc:/opt/emqx/etc
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"  # mqtt:tcp
      - "8883:8883"  # mqtt:tcp:ssl
      - "8083:8083"  # mqtt:ws
      - "8084:8084"  # mqtt:ws:ssl
      - "8081:8081"  # http:management
      - "18083:18083"  # http:dashboard
      - "61613:61613"  # web-stomp gateway
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/opt/emqx/bin/emqx_ctl", "status"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 25s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  emqx-data: {}
  emqx-log: {}
  emqx-etc: {}
```

After starting the instance, follow the [Gateway instructions](/gateway/installation/#start-the-instance) to generate certificates and set your Gateway passphrase. Then, uncomment the lines below to add the passphrase, and then re-launch the instance:

```yaml
  environment:
    - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=[passphrase] # Replace with 'gateway generate-certs' passphrase
```

To configure the broker, attach to the EMQX Broker emqx instance:

```
docker attach emqx
```

Navigate to the EMQX dashboard to configure authentication and available ports at <http://localhost:18083/>. The default credentials for connecting to the EMQX dashboard are: `admin:public`. 

To connect to your bots via MQTT, leave the `mqtt_username` and `mqtt_password` parameters of the bot empty.

### Hummingbot with Dashboard

This configuration starts a single Hummingbot alongside a [Dashboard](/dashboard/) instance that can be used to control and analyze it.. To use it, replace the content of the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in your Hummingbot root folder with the code below.


```bash
services:
  hummingbot:
    container_name: hummingbot
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/home/hummingbot/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/scripts:/home/hummingbot/conf/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/home/hummingbot/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/home/hummingbot/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/hummingbot/certs"
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
  dashboard:
    container_name: dashboard
    image: hummingbot/dashboard:latest
    volumes:
      - ./hummingbot_files/data:/home/dashboard/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "8501:8501"
```

Afterwards, go to <http://localhost:8501> in your browser to see the Dashboard.
