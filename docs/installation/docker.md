We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if you want the simplest, easiest installation method and don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase.

## Prerequisites

Hummingbot runs on commodity hardware and does not require much memory or storage.

* **Operating System**: MacOS 10.12.6+ / Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 10+) / Windows 10+
* **Memory**: 4 GB RAM per instance
* **Storage**: 5 GB HDD space per instance

## Installation Process

### 1. Install Docker Compose

Hummingbot uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 

!!! note "For Windows users"
    To install Docker on Windows, [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) is needed. Follow [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL2 on your Windows system. Afterwards, proceed to the instructions above to install Docker Compose.

The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.


After installing Docker Desktop, verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
docker compose version
```

The output should be: `Docker Compose version v2.17.2` or similar. 

!!! warning
    Ensure that you are using Docker Compose V2, since Compose V1 is deprecated and the examples assume that you are using Compose V2.

### 2. Clone Repo

Enter the following commands in Bash/Terminal to clone the Hummingbot Github repo and enter the root folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot.git
cd hummingbot
```

### 3. Pull Image

The `docker-compose.yml` file in the root folder provides a basic configuration for launching an instance.

```yaml
services:
  hummingbot:
    container_name: hummingbot
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./conf:/home/hummingbot/conf
      - ./conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors
      - ./conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies
      - ./conf/controllers:/home/hummingbot/conf/controllers
      - ./conf/scripts:/home/hummingbot/conf/scripts
      - ./logs:/home/hummingbot/logs
      - ./data:/home/hummingbot/data
      - ./certs:/home/hummingbot/certs
      - ./scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts
      - ./controllers:/home/hummingbot/controllers
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
    #  environment:
    #    - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
    #    - CONFIG_FILE_NAME=simple_pmm_example.py
    #    - SCRIPT_CONFIG=conf_simple_pmm_example.yaml
```

You will be able to modify this file and uncomment lines in order to automatically enter your pasword and start strategies. For now, we can use it as-is. 

Run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:

```bash
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container hummingbot  Started 
```

### 4. Attach to Instance

The `-d` flag runs Hummingbot in detached mode. Attach to it by running the command:

```bash
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should now see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

To get started with Hummingbot, check out the following pages and guides:

* [Basic Features](/client/)
* [V2 Strategy Walkthough](/v2-strategies/walkthrough/)
* [Hummingbot FAQ](/faq/)

## Advanced Configurations

### Autostart Strategy

This configures a Hummingbot instance to automatically start a script or strategy when the Docker instance is instantiated.

Uncomment the following lines in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L27C5-L30C54):

```yaml
  environment:
    - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a       # Replace "a" with your Hummingbot password
    - CONFIG_FILE_NAME=simple_pmm_example.py    # Replace with your script filename
    - SCRIPT_CONFIG=conf_simple_pmm_example.yaml   # Replace with your script config file (or leave commented)
```

Afterwards, stop the instance with `docker compose down` and re-launch it with `docker compose up -d`. When you attach to the instance, your strategy should already be running.


### Hummingbot + Gateway

[Gateway](/gateway) is API middleware that helps Hummingbot connect to DEXs on various blockchains. To launch Hummingbot with Gateway, uncomment the Gateway section of [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml#L33), except for the `environment` lines:

```yaml
  gateway:
    container_name: "gateway"
    image: hummingbot/gateway:latest    
    ports:
      - "15888:15888"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./gateway_files/conf:/usr/src/app/conf"
      - "./gateway_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/gateway/certs"
    # environment:
    #  - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions in [Gateway - Installation](/gateway/installation) to generate certificates and connect Gateway to Hummingbot.

### Multiple Hummingbot Instances

This configuration launches two Hummingbot Docker instances with the container names `hummingbot-1` and `hummingbot-2`. To use it, replace the content of [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in your Hummingbot root folder with the code below.

If you add more instances, make sure to set `container_name` to something unique.

```bash
services:
  hummingbot-1:
    container_name: hummingbot-1
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/home/hummingbot/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/home/hummingbot/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/home/hummingbot/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/hummingbot/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host

  hummingbot-2:
    container_name: hummingbot-2
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/home/hummingbot/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/home/hummingbot/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/home/hummingbot/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/home/hummingbot/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/home/hummingbot/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/home/hummingbot/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/hummingbot/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host
```

Note that the above configuration has both bots sharing the **hummingbot_files** folder, which is where configs, logs, and databases are stored. If you want to set a different folder for `hummingbot-2`, set `volumes` to a different folder path, such as **hummingbot_files_2**. 

Attach to instance 1:
```bash
docker attach hummingbot-1
``` 

Attach to instance 2:

```bash
docker attach hummingbot-2
```

See [Deploy Examples](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples) for more information about running multiple instances of Hummingbot with different credentials.

### Hummingbot + Gateway + Broker

This configuration starts instances of Hummingbot, [Gateway](/gateway/), and [EMQX Broker](/installation/broker/). To use it, replace the content of the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) in your Hummingbot root folder with the code below.


```bash
services:
  hummingbot:
    container_name: "hummingbot"
    image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
    volumes:
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf:/conf"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/connectors:/conf/connectors"
      - "./hummingbot_files/conf/strategies:/conf/strategies"
      - "./hummingbot_files/logs:/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/data:/data"
      - "./hummingbot_files/scripts:/scripts"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
          max-size: "10m"
          max-file: "5"
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    network_mode: host

  gateway:
    container_name: "gateway"
    image: hummingbot/gateway:latest
    ports:
      - "15888:15888"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - "./gateway_files/conf:/usr/src/app/conf"
      - "./gateway_files/logs:/usr/src/app/logs"
      - "./hummingbot_files/certs:/home/gateway/certs"
    # environment:
    #   - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a

  emqx:
    container_name: "emqx"
    image: emqx:5
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMQX_NAME=emqx
      - EMQX_LOADED_PLUGINS="emqx_recon,emqx_retainer,emqx_management,emqx_dashboard"
    volumes:
      - emqx-data:/opt/emqx/data
      - emqx-log:/opt/emqx/log
      - emqx-etc:/opt/emqx/etc
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"  # mqtt:tcp
      - "8883:8883"  # mqtt:tcp:ssl
      - "8083:8083"  # mqtt:ws
      - "8084:8084"  # mqtt:ws:ssl
      - "8081:8081"  # http:management
      - "18083:18083"  # http:dashboard
      - "61613:61613"  # web-stomp gateway
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "/opt/emqx/bin/emqx_ctl", "status"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 25s
      retries: 5

volumes:
  emqx-data: {}
  emqx-log: {}
  emqx-etc: {}
```

After starting the instance, follow the [Gateway instructions](/gateway/installation/) to generate certificates and set your Gateway passphrase

To configure the EMQX Broker, attach to the `emqx` instance:
```
docker attach emqx
```

To configure authentication and available ports, navigate to the EMQX dashboard at <http://localhost:18083/>. The default credentials are: `admin:public`. 

To connect to your bots via MQTT, leave the `mqtt_username` and `mqtt_password` parameters of the bot empty.

### Multiple Bots + subaccounts (multiple credentials)

This configuration allows you to create multiple bots and configure the bots to use either a `master_account` or `sub_accounts` for credentials and API keys. This feature is particularly useful if you manage multiple API keys or have set up subaccounts on exchanges and wish for an easy method to switch between them.

For more detailed instructions on setting up and running multiple bots with `master_account` or `sub_accounts`, please refer to the readme in the [deploy-examples](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples) repository on GitHub.
