Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit organization established in the Cayman Islands. The Foundation’s mission is to democratize high-frequency trading by maintaining the open-source Hummingbot code repository and the HBOT governance system.

Since we open sourced Hummingbot in 2019, it has become the **leading open source market making bot**, used by token projects who want to own their liquidity, smaller trading firms, as well as individual traders who run bots to earn liquidity mining rewards.

Currently, Hummingbot is evolving from a simple market making bot into a powerful open source platform that helps you **create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots** running any algo trading strategy. Our main repos now include:

* [hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot): Python-based core trading engine and exchange connectors
* [gateway](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway): Typescript-based middleware that helps Hummingbot connect to DEXs and blockchain networks
* [dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard): Streamlit-based dashboard for backtesting, deploying, and managing Hummingbot instances

We believe there's a singular opportunity to scale Hummingbot into an **open source operating system for crypto algo traders**, an indispensable, community-maintained, and free tool that levels the playing field against the biggest players!

Sponsorships support the Hummingbot Foundation core team, keeping these new tools free and open source and allowing us to adhere to the core principles that underpin Hummingbot’s development:

* **Open Source**: The Hummingbot codebase is publicly available, auditable, and free
* **Modular**: Hummingbot modules can be independently built, used, and maintained by community members
* **Extensible**: Users can use Hummingbot to create any trading strategy on any exchange and blockchain
* **All Levels**: Hummingbot is designed for use by individuals and professionals alike
