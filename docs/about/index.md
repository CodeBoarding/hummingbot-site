Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit organization established in the Cayman Islands. The Foundation’s mission is to democratize high-frequency trading by maintaining the open-source Hummingbot code repository and the HBOT governance system.

Since we open sourced Hummingbot in 2019, it has become the **leading open source market making bot**, used by token projects who want to own their liquidity, smaller trading firms, as well as individual traders who run bots to earn liquidity mining rewards.

Currently, Hummingbot is evolving from a simple market making bot into a powerful open source platform that helps you **create, backtest, deploy, and manage a fleet of bots** running any algo trading strategy. Our main repos now include:

* [`hummingbot/hummingbot`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot): The Hummingbot client that contains the core trading engine and connectors
* [`hummingbot/gateway`](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway): Middleware that standardizes DEX API endpoints on different blockchain networks
* [`hummingbot/dashboard`](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard): Application that helps you create, backtest, deploy, and manage Hummingbot instances
* [`hummingbot/deploy-examples`](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples): Examples of how to deploy Hummingbot using Docker Compose
* [`hummingbot/hummingbot-site`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-site): The official website for Hummingbot Foundation and documentation site for Hummingbot

## Sponsorships
