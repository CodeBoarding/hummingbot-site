## How to create API keys

Log in to your AscendEX account using your PC and visit profile icon ‚Äì [API Setting].

   [![Create API](ascendex-api1.png)](ascendex-api1.png)

Click [New API Key] in the upper right corner of the page.

   [![New API](ascendex-api2.png)](ascendex-api2.png)

Create a name for the new API key and set up API permissions and IP address restrictions. Complete a three-step verification by entering your phone, email, and Google verification code. Click [Generate API Key] to complete the process.

   [![Create API name](ascendex-api3.png)](ascendex-api3.png)

A pop-up containing both public and private API keys will appear on your screen. Please keep a copy of both keys, as they will only be viewable to you during this stage of the setup. 
For account security, never share your API keys. In the case of a lost or forgotten API key, it is advised to delete the old API and create new keys immediately.

   [![API text](ascendex-api4.png)](ascendex-api4.png)

After creating an API key, you can Edit or Delete your API keys under the Action tab.

   [![API Done](ascendex-api5.png)](ascendex-api5.png)

### Notes:

- API keys without an IP address will only remain valid for 365 days.
- Up to 20 IP addresses can be bound to one API key.
- For security enhancement, it is recommended that only IP addresses in users API's whitelist make API calls to users' network. An "unrestricted" setting will allow all IPs to access the network, decreasing account security.
- Multiple IP addresses must be separated by half-width commas during the setup.
