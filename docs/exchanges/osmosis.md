## üîë How to Connect

Create an Osmosis wallet or use and existing Cosmos wallet on one of the supported networks below:

| Chain | Networks |
| --- | --- |
| osmosis | mainnet, testnet |

### üåå Cosmos & IBC Wallets

The Cosmos ecosystem is a collection of blockchains built using the [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), which communicate with eachother over the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol ([IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc/)).

Similar to multichain wallets such as Metamask, Cosmos ecosystem wallets come with high interoperability built-in - though *specific networks may need to be manually added*.

The following are Osmosis-compatible browser-wallets:
- [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) | Tested ‚úî
- [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/) | Tested ‚úî | Preferred üëç
- [Trust](https://trustwallet.com/) | Untested ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) | Untested ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- [Others](https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/osmosis/wallets/) | Untested ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### üîê Get Private Key from Keplr

Keplr is the most popular Cosmos-based wallet. When creating a Keplr wallet, **only users who link a Google Account are able to export their private key directly from Keplr**.

To get around this, you can:
1. Export your Keplr seed phrase.
2. Restore the wallet using the seed phrase, in a different Cosmos-based wallet (such as Leap wallet) which allows exporting the private key.
3. Export the private key from the newly restored wallet.

**Note:** Also be aware the exported private key may have an `0x` at the start, which may need to be **removed** to fit the private key format check.
- Before: `0x1234567890000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- After: `1234567890000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

### üîå Connect with Gateway

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `gateway connect osmosis` in order to connect your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want osmosis to connect to? (osmosis) >>>
Which network do you want osmosis to connect to? (mainnet, testnet) >>>
Enter your osmosis-mainnet private key >>>>

```

If connection is successful (osmosis-mainnet):

```
The osmosis connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on osmosis-mainnet

```
