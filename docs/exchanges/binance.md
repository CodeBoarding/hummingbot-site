## How to create API keys

Log in to your Binance account and click **Profile** - **[API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)**

   ![Step 1](binance-api1.png)

Click **Create API**. Please note that before creating an API Key, you need to:

   - Enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/account-functions?c=1&navId=1#11) on your account.
   - Make a deposit of any amount to activate your account.

   ![Step 2](binance-api2.png)

Select **System generated** as your preferred API Key type. For more details on self-generated API Keys, please refer to [How to Generate an RSA Key Pair to Send API Requests on Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/2b79728f331e43079b27440d9d15c5db).

   ![Step 3](binance-api3.png)

Enter a label/name for your API Key.

   ![Step 4](binance-api4.png)

Verify your request with 2FA devices.

   ![Step 5](binance-api5.png)

   [![Step 6](binance-api6.png)](binance-api6.png)

Your API Key is now created. Do not disclose your API Key, Secret Key (HMAC), or Private Key (RSA) to anyone to avoid asset losses. If you forget your Secret Key, you'll need to delete the API and create a new one.
