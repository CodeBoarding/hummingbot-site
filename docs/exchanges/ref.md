Create a wallet on one of the supported networks below:

| Chain | Networks | 
| ----- | -------- |
| `near`| `mainnet`, `testnet`|

From inside the Hummingbot client, run `gateway connect ref_finance` in order to connect your wallet:
 
```
Which chain do you want ref-finance to connect to? (near) >>> 
Which network do you want ref-finance to connect to? (mainnet, testnet) >>>
Enter your near-mainnet private key >>>>
```

If connection is successful (near-mainnet):
```
The ref-finance connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on near-mainnet
```
