!!! note
    Gateway V2 comes with Avalanche's public RPC URL by default, which is good enough for short-term testing. But for real trading bots, you should configure your own node URL (e.g. via Moralis Speedy Nodes) which gives you higher API request rate limits.


# `openocean`

The Openocean protocol connector is managed by Gateway V2 - where the Gateway is now responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating trade transactions), and the `GatewayEVMAMM` class on Hummingbot side is responsible for interfacing with Gateway V2.

!!! note
    Gateway V2 is currently living on kanghoulin's `feat/gateway-v2_openocean` branch at the moment - it will be merged to Hummingbot master within a month or two.
