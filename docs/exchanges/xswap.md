### How to Connect

The `xswap` connector fetches prices and creates swaps. Run `gateway connect xswap` in order to connect your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want xswap to connect to? (xdc-chain) >>>
Which network do you want xswap to connect to? (xinfin, apothem) >>>
Enter your xdc-chain-xinfin private key >>>>
```

If connection is successful:

```
The xswap connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on xdc-chain-xinfin
```
