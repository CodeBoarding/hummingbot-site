## 🔑 About Rate Limits

- The system enforces rate limits using a fixed window algorithm, replenishing the request allowance every 5 seconds to maintain system stability. Market makers can access higher rate limits upon request by contacting the support team.

# Rate Limits

The below rate limits have been implemented to safeguard our system. Rate limiters use a **"fixed window" algorithm** to discretely refill the request allowance every 5 seconds.

**Market makers are eligible for higher rate limits.**  
To apply for increased rates, please contact our support team.

| Type          | Matching | Per-Instrument Matching | Non-Matching | Connections      | Burst Multiplier |
|---------------|----------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Trader        | 1 TPS    | 1 TPS                    | 5 TPS         | 4x per IP        | 5x               |
| Market Maker  | 500+ TPS | 10+ TPS                  | 500+ TPS      | up to 64x per IP | 5x               |

> **Note:**  
> Burst requests for both REST and WebSockets are refreshed every 5 seconds.  
> For example, a trader can send 5× matching requests in a single burst but must wait 5 seconds before any further requests can be sent.


## Matching, Non-Matching, and Custom Requests

The below requests are counted as **matching** and **per-instrument matching** requests:

- `private/order`
- `private/replace` *(counted as 1 request)*
- `private/cancel`
- `private/cancel_by_nonce`
- `private/cancel_by_instrument`
- `private/cancel_by_label` *(if `instrument_name` param is set)*

### Custom Rate-Limited Requests

- `private/cancel_all` – **1 TPS**
- `private/cancel_by_label` – **10 TPS** *(if `instrument_name` param is **NOT** set)*

All requests outside of the above are counted as **non-matching**.

---

## REST

All **non-matching** requests over the **REST API** are rate limited per IP at a flat **10 TPS** with a **5x burst**.

If the limit is crossed, a **`429 Too Many Requests`** response is returned.
