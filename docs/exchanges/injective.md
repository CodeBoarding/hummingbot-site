### How to Connect

Run `gateway connect injective` in order to connect to your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want injective to connect to? (injective) >>>
Which network do you want injective to connect to? (mainnet, testnet)

Enter your injective-mainnet wallet private key >>>

Enter your injective-mainnet sub account id wallet key (input 0 if unsure) >>>
```

If connection is successful:

```
The injective connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on injective-mainnet
```


### Order Types



### Candles Feed


### Paper Trading



## 🔀 Perp Connector
*Connector to perpetual futures markets*



### How to Connect

Run `gateway connect injective_perpetual` in order to connect to your wallet:

```
Which chain do you want injective_perpetual to connect to? (injective) >>>
Which network do you want injective_perpetual to connect to? (mainnet, testnet)

Enter your injective-mainnet wallet private key >>>

Enter your injective-mainnet sub account id wallet key (input 0 if unsure) >>>
```

If connection is successful:

```
The injective_perpetual connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on injective-mainnet
```


### Order Types


### Position Modes

This connector supports the following position modes:

- One-way
- Hedge

### Candles Feed


### Testnets

Run `gateway connect injective_perpetual` in order to connect to  the injective_perpetual testnet:

```
Which chain do you want injective_perpetual to connect to? (injective) >>> injective
Which network do you want injective_perpetual to connect to? (mainnet, testnet) testnet

Enter your injective-mainnet wallet private key >>>

Enter your injective-mainnet sub account id wallet key (input 0 if unsure) >>>
```

If connection is successful:

```
The injective_perpetual connector now uses wallet [pubKey] on injective-testnet
```
