# `pangolin`

The Pangolin connector in [Gateway](/gateway) is responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating swap transactions).

It interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMAMM`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_AMM.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with all EVM-based Gateway AMMs.

## üë∑ Developer

Added by CoinAlpha in [v1.4.0](/release-notes/1.4.0/) 

## üîë Setup

1. Follow the instructions on [Setting up Gateway](/gateway/setup) to install the Gateway Docker container, but **DO NOT** run `gateway connect pangolin` yet.
2. Run `gateway config avalanche.nodeKey` and enter your [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) Speedy Node API key (i.e. `https://speedy-nodes-nyc.moralis.io/<API-KEY>/avalanche/mainnet`).
3. Alternatively, run `gateway config avalanche.networks.avalanche.nodeURL` and add the RPC URL from any provider. You can use the default Avalanche RPC endpoint `https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`, but it may be slow.
4. Now, run `gateway connect pangolin` and add your Avalanche wallet private key. Like all API and private keys in Hummingbot, this key is encrypted with your Hummingbot password.
5. Afterwards, run `create` to create an [AMM Arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arbitrage/) strategy between Pangolin and a different exchange.
6. Run `start` to start the strategy, and you're trading!
