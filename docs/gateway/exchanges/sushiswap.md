# `sushiswap`

The SushiSwap connector in [Gateway](/gateway) is responsible for all on-chain operations (e.g. fetching prices and creating swap transactions).

It interfaces with the [`GatewayEVMAMM`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/hummingbot/connector/gateway_EVM_AMM.py) class in the Hummingbot client, which is responsible for interfacing with all EVM-based Gateway AMMs.
