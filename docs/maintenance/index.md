The Hummingbot Foundationâ€™s primary role is to coordinate the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the open source Hummingbot codebase via a decentralized set of actors: **Exchanges**, **Contributors**, and **Users**.

* **Exchanges** are centralized or decentralized exchanges, blockchain protocols, other other organizations who enter into fee share and/or other referral agreements with Hummingbot Foundation based on user trading volume. 

* **Contributors** are individual developers and firms that build and maintain Hummingbot components. Contributors submit their as pull requests to the official Github repository, and they are paid capture [bounties](./bounties) when that work has been merged and included in an official release. [Bounties](./bounties) may be funded by either Hummingbot Foundation or other community members.

* **Users** are individual and professional traders who install and use the Hummingbot open source software, released every month, to run trading bots. The volume they generate on partner exchanges sustains the operations of Hummingbot Foundation.

## Process

!!! note "New maintenance process for Epoch 2"
    After learning from the initial process used in Epoch 1, the Foundation has started a new process in Epoch 2 that prioritizes community involvement.

Hummingbot employs a decentralized, community-driven maintenance process. See [Process](./process) for more information.

## Exchange certification

Hummingbot users around the world trade billions in volume every day using our open source software. Hummingbot Foundation partners with exchanges who enter into fee share agreements with us and attain certification.
