# Active Connector Maintenance Agreements

Maintaining connectors requires significant effort, since Hummingbot is a constantly evolving codebase and the cryptocurrency market landscape also changes rapidly. Connectors are continually improved to accommodate more asset types, as well to increase performance and reliability. In addition, exchange APIs are continually being updated. To ensure that each connector can be properly maintained, each connector has a **Maintainer**.

Exchanges enter into contractual agreements with the Foundation and its associates that rebate a portion of fees incurred by Users of the Hummingbot software, measured via unique identifiers in API request headers or blockchain transaction memo fields. These fees are remitted to the Foundation on a monthly basis and will be shared with the Maintainer of the connector. On a monthly basis, the Foundation will publish the total amount of fees shared from each Sponsor and how much was paid to Maintainers.
