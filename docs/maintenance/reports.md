* **Fee-Generating Volume**: estimated level of trading volume based on fees rebated and exchange fee structure

In addition, the report will list other future sources of funds, such as income from administering bounties and hackathons.

## Uses of funds

The report will list how the Foundation's monthly income is allocated on an aggregate basis:

* **Maintenance**: Payments to exchange connector maintainers
* **Staff**: Payments to Foundation staff
* **Treasury**: Remaining amounts are deposited in Foundation treasury and may be directed via community voting
