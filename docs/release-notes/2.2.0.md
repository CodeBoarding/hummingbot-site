## Hummingbot 2.2.0 Highlights


### Executor Improvements

- Added new [`GridExecutor`](../v2-strategies/executors/gridexecutor.md) to handle grid orders

- Improvements added to the existing `ArbitrageExecutor` 

-  Added `rate_sources` function to dynamically set up and initialize market data for trading, gas tokens, and quote conversions. This should help in certain cases where the `rate_oracle` is unable to fetch the required data.
 

### New Dashboard Controller - Grid Strike

The **Grid Strike** strategy creates a grid of orders within specified price ranges, offering new tools to enhance strategy setup and execution:  

- Dynamic Price Range Defaults: Auto-adjusts grid ranges using live market data for adaptive trading.  

- Visual Grid Configuration: Displays grid ranges and orders on charts for precise adjustments.  

- Multi-Range Support: Enables up to 5 grid ranges with independent settings and allocations.  

- Advanced Risk Management Tools: Adds bounds, time limits, and minimum spreads for controlled trading.
