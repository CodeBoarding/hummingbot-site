!!! note
    The [Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), [Backend-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/backend-api), and [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) repositories will now follow a continuous deployment model without fixed version releases. This approach allows for more frequent updates and improved maintainability of these components.

## How to Update

### Docker

Re-run the [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) setup script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy.git
cd deploy
bash setup.sh
```

For individual images, exit running containers, pull the latest images, and restart:
```bash
docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
git pull origin master # Hummingbot
git pull origin main # Gateway
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/source/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights

### New Solana and Jupiter DEX Connectors

In this release, [Hummingbot #7334](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7334) & [Gateway #374](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/374) introduces new connectors for the Solana blockchain and the Jupiter DEX aggregator to the Gateway middleware, along with a Solana class in the Hummingbot client to interface with them. 

Users can now use the Arbitrage Controller (see below) or the [AMM arbitrage](/strategies/amm-arbitrage/) V1 strategy to run arbitrage strategies between Jupiter and other Hummingbot-supported exchanges. See the [Jupiter](/exchanges/jupiter/) documentation for more information.

### New Hyperliquid Spot Connector

This release adds support for Hyperliquid spot markets in [Hummingbot #7282](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7282), funded by the Hyperliquid Connector Pot voted by the HBOT token holders in quarterly polls. See the [Hyperliquid](/exchanges/hyperliquid/) documentation for more information.

### New Arbitrage Controller

The new **Arbitrage** controller is a revamped V2 version of our legacy arbitrage strategies. It enables high-performance arbitrage trading between any two spot exchanges (AMM or CLOB), using the new `ArbitrageExecutor` component to manage order execution. 

The strategy includes several key features:

- Configurable price feeds from both exchange rates and external oracles
- Automatic spread detection and order placement
- Support for both spot and perpetual markets
- Comprehensive risk management capabilities including minimum spread requirements, maximum position sizes, and cooldown periods between trades
- The enhanced rate oracle system allows flexible sourcing of price data from multiple feeds to ensure reliable arbitrage opportunities

### New GridStrike Controller

Similarly, rhe new **GridStrike** Strategy V2 controller introduces a classic grid strategy to the V2 framework that allows users to create and maintain a grid of orders within specified price ranges, and uses the new `GridExecutor` component to manage them. 

The strategy includes several key features:

- Automatic grid range adjustment based on real-time market data
- Visual configuration tools for viewing and modifying grid ranges on charts
- Support for up to 5 independent grid ranges with customizable settings
- Comprehensive risk management capabilities including price bounds, time limits, and minimum spread requirements
