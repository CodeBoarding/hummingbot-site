## Improved Deployment Options

## New Gateway CLOB Connector: `dexalot`

`Dexalot` Dexalot is a revolutionary decentralized exchange aiming at bringing the traditional centralized exchange look and feel, through a decentralized on-chain application.  It is built on Avalanche, the fastest smart contracts platform in the blockchain industry.

See the [dexalot](/exchanges/dexalot/) connector documentation for more information.

## Hedge Strategy updates

Here are the latest changes:

* **Disable Auto Set Position:** In response to user feedback, we've added the ability to disable the auto set position feature on some exchanges, such as Bybit, that have experienced issues with this feature. You now have greater control over your position management.

* **Interval Logging:** We've also added interval logging to help you keep track of your Hedge Strategy performance. This will allow you to review your trading activity at a glance and make informed decisions going forward.

* **Active Orders Management:** To ensure that active orders are cancelled at the correct time, we've moved the check and cancel active orders function to the start of the tick. This improvement ensures that you're always trading with accurate information.

* **Timestamp Update:** We've made an update to the way timestamps are handled to prevent network and exchange errors from skipping the current hedge cycle. The last timestamp is now updated only at the end of the cycle, ensuring that your trades are executed as intended.
