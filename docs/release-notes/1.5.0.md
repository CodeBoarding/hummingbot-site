## New Gateway Connector: Sushiswap
[Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap) (SUSHI) is a decentralized exchange (or DEX) built on the Ethereum network. Originally forked from Uniswap, SushiSwap leverages smart contracts in order to provide liquidity pools that allow users to directly trade crypto assets — with no intermediary. Users can also become liquidity pool providers, supplying an equal value pair of two cryptocurrencies in order to receive rewards whenever anyone utilizes that pool. It is a decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocol.

## New Fixed Grid Strategy

In this release, we are happy to introduce the `Fixed Grid` strategy for Hummingbot which is also the first community strategy created under the Developer Grant proposal [HGP-4](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0xd0c5b54badfd631d7433da0f76795a9dc0d82fc66596d547cda2f3537f903e3f)

The fixed grid strategy is often the entry point of users to algorithmic trading in crypto. It is available free to use on popular exchanges such as Binance and Kucoin. The fixed grid strategy is a useful tool for market making in consolidating / range-bound price action, and for stablecoin pairs. The only parameters needed to set up this strategy are the grid ceiling price, the grid floor price and the number of grid levels.

More information in [Fixed Grid](/strategies/fixed_grid) documentation.
