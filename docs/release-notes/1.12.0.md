We are very excited to ship the January 2023 Hummingbot release (v1.12.0) today! See below for the highlights in this release.

## Epoch 3 Polls Changes

Recently, we finished the first set of [Polls](https://docs.hummingbot.org/governance/polls/), a new initiative that lets HBOT holders decide how the Foundation allocates its engineering bandwidth and developer bounties across the components in the Hummingbot codebase. Based on the results of the Polls, below are the outline of the changes made initially in this release.  

- Removed CEX connectors that didn't pass quorum from the codebase
- Removed DEX connectors that didn't pass quorum from the codebase
- Removed `Fixed Grid` and `Arbitrage` strategies since they didn't meet quorum
- Running the `connect` command reflects the CEX connector tiers (Gold, Silver, Bronze), also a new command was added `gateway list` to display all available DEX connectors and their tiers

For more details of the Epoch 3 poll results check our blog post - <https://blog.hummingbot.org/epoch-3-polls/>

## Phase I of `Bot Orchestration` released by  klpanagi and TheHolyRoger

Phase 1 will provide a clean communication and messaging layer and allow for remote control and monitoring of multi-bot environments in a distributed context. Meaning that bots can "live" on different machines and infrastructures (e.g. having a bot local and another bot on AWS).

To achieve this approach, Phase 1 implements an MQTT layer for bots to connect remotely to message brokers, as a single point of reference, using asynchronous bidirectional communication channels (push/pull). In this architecture, bots can be considered as clients to the overall environment. Bot scaling is seamless and does not require any further setup, anyone can connect any number of bots the a message broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, EMQX etc) without any other dependencies.

Outline of the features included in Phase I

Interface to execute remote commands
Commands covered:
    - Start
    - Stop
    - Import
    - Config strategy
    - Balance
    - Change balance limits
All this commands can be called using an unified web application that also receives the following information from the bots:
    - Heartbeat - Status
    - PNL - History

- The configuration of the broker in the client should be in the `conf_client.yml` file

See this [page](https://www.notion.so/hummingbot-foundation/Bot-Orchestration-fcac18bd90d74b0ebca9b260617522f0) for a requirements doc for this project and past discussions.

## Additional fixes to the `hedge` Strategy

Key changes:

- Add more info to facilitate debugging.
- Refactor the status screen and add more information and log
- Fixed position name referring to True and False to ONE-WAY and HEDGE
- Fixed issues related to typing
- For hedge by amount,
    a. change the matching of pairs from the match by trading pair to match by base asset
    b. change hedge price calculation for hedge by the amount to use mid-price instead of VWAP price.
    i. This is mainly used to calculate the market price to put since hummingbot only allows limit orders. Users can still increase slippage to guarantee their trade is made.

## New Spot Connector - CI-EX

## New Cosmos Chain

This release adds a Cosmos chain base that can be used to add other Cosmos-based chains and connectors like Sifchain.

See the [Cosmos](/gateway/chains/) documentation for more information.

## Gateway UX improvements

We've added multiple ways users can approve tokens for spending on Gateway in this pull request

- [6005](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6005) Added methods to approve tokens

  - Using the `approve-token` command
  - Approve manually using the DEX interface
  - Approve manually using Etherscan

See the [Gateway Setup](/gateway/setup) documentation page for more information on how to approve tokens.

Also removed the auto approval method from Gateway and added the `btc.b` token to the tokenlist

- [5997](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/5997) Removed auto approval from `gateway_evm_amm`
- [6016](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6016) Added the `btc.b` token to the Avalanche tokenlist
