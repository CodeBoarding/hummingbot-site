## Improvements to Strategy V2 Framework
 
[![](/v2-strategies/diagrams/14.png)](/v2-strategies/diagrams/14.png)

We refactored the new Strategy V2 framework to make it simpler and more scalable. 

Now, the new Market Data Provider provides a single, unified point of access to a market's data, including historical candles, trades, and real-time order book data. Multiple controllers running individual sub-strategies can share this data and use it to control sophisticated, automated Executors.

Check out the new [Strategy V2 docs](../v2-strategies/index.md) for detailed walkthroughs, sample strategies, and more!

## New TWAPExecutor Component

!!! Warning
    This component is still in beta and there may be some issues when using it. For more information on the reported issues or if you want to report a bug please submit them to our [Github - Issues](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yml&title=Bug+Report) page

[TWAPExecutor](../v2-strategies/executors/twapexecutor.md) is a new Strategy V2 component that can be used by itself or combined with other components. It programmatically executes orders at regular time intervals, helping you achieve a time-weighted average price for rebalancing and other purposes.

## New CEX Connectors: OKX Perpetual, Kraken, Bitrue

We're excited to introduce three connectors to the codebase. All were built by community developers with funding provided by approved Hummingbot Improvement Proposals:

* [OKX Perpetual](../exchanges/okx/okx.md): New connector to OKX perpetual futures markets. See pull request [#6848](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6848) and **thanks to [tomasgaudino](https://github.com/tomasgaudino) for this contribution! üôè**

* [Kraken](../exchanges/kraken/index.md): Updated connector to Kraken spot markets. See pull request [#6840](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6840) and **thanks to [yancong001](https://github.com/yancong001) for this contribution! üôè**

## New DEX/Chain Connector: Osmosis

[Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Cosmos blockchain, emphasizing interoperability and user sovereignty. It stands out for its advanced features, such as superfluid staking and liquidity pools with customizable parameters, allowing users to tailor their trading and staking strategies. Osmosis facilitates cross-chain transactions through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling seamless swaps across a growing ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. 

For more information, see the [Osmosis](../exchanges/osmosis.md) and [Chain Connectors - Osmosis](../chains/osmosis-chain.md) for the respective DEX and chain documentation pages.

**Pull Request:**  [#277](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/277)

**Snapshot Proposal:** <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0x2e159b270c17ac68f47774a7dc6741aab48b638274cfc6519d38b1847351901a>

**Thanks to [nkhrs](https://github.com/nkhrs) and [chasevoorhees](https://github.com/chasevoorhees) for their significant contribution to this integration! üôè**

## New Connector Guides

In the last release, we introduced Connector Guides, step-by-step instructions that show users how to generate credentials on various centralized and decentralized exchanges and how to use them with Hummingbot.

This release introduces three new guides:

* [Dexalot](../academy-content/posts/using-dexalot-with-hummingbot/index.md)
* [Vega](../academy-content/posts/using-vega-protocol-with-hummingbot/index.md)
* [Osmosis](../academy-content/posts/using-osmosis-with-hummingbot/index.md)

We encourage community members to contribute more connector guides to <https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot-site>!
