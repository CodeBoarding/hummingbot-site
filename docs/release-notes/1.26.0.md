This release also introduces a new **Bitrue** CEX connector, expands our decentralized exchange capabilities with support for the **Osmosis chain and DEX**, and adds a **perpetuals connector for OKX**.

## Connector Guides

We are excited to introduce Connector Guides, step-by-step instructions that show users how to generate credentials on various centralized and decentralized exchanges and how to use them with Hummingbot. 

### Dexalot

The [Dexalot guide](../blog/posts/dexalot-integration-guide/index.md) takes you through the steps of connecting with the Dexalot decentralized exchange platform, funding your account, and setting up automated trading using Hummingbot. This comprehensive tutorial includes creating a wallet, selecting the appropriate network, depositing funds for trading, and configuring the Hummingbot software for seamless integration with Dexalot.

See [Tag: Connector Guides](/academy/all/#tag:connector-guides) for a full list of the current guides. HBOT holders can propose [Bounties](/bounties) to fund the creation of additional guides by community contributors.


## New Chain / DEX Connector: Osmosis

[Osmosis](https://app.osmosis.zone/) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Cosmos blockchain, emphasizing interoperability and user sovereignty. It stands out for its advanced features, such as superfluid staking and liquidity pools with customizable parameters, allowing users to tailor their trading and staking strategies. Osmosis facilitates cross-chain transactions through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, enabling seamless swaps across a growing ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. 

For more information, see the [Osmosis](../exchanges/osmosis.md) and [Chain Connectors - Osmosis](../chains/osmosis-chain.md) for the respective DEX and chain documentation pages.
