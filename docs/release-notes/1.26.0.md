# Hummingbot v1.26.0 Release Notes

*Released on March 25, 2024*

## Introduction

We're thrilled to unveil Hummingbot version 1.25.0! This release features new **Connector Guides** for Binance, Vega, Hyperliquid, and Polkadex, which make it easy for users to get started running bots on these exchanges with step-by-step instructions that show users how to generate credentials and use them with Hummingbot. Furthermore, we are excited to announce big improvements to the **Discord Support Program**, which rewards users for supporting other users on Discord by answering their questions. In addition, this release introduces the new **Carbon** DEX connector, adds Candles support for **OKX Perpetual** and **Kraken**, and greatly improves the **XRP Ledger** connector.

Last but not least, we are in the middle of a huge refactor to the **V2 Strategies Framework** and added two new sample strategies in this release. When this overhaul is complete, the V2 framework will be more intuitive and flexible for strategy development, paving the way for advanced trading strategies and customization.
