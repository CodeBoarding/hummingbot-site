## Community Strategy: Cross Exchange Mining

The cross exchange mining strategy sets orders on a maker exchange and seeks to profit off of the difference in the spread between taker and maker exchanges. The strategy is similar to the cross exchange market making strategy however it is more reliable in ensuring orders on the taker side are filled and assets remain hedged and balanced across exchanges.
