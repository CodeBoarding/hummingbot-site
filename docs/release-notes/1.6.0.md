!!! warning
    As this new version will automatically migrate any old configuration files due to the config management refactoring, we strongly advise users to create a backup of the config files first prior to updating the bots to 1.6.0. The migration process may also take some time or may encounter issues so it's advisable to implement the update at a more convenient period. Lastly, make sure to remove any existing scripts you have and download instead the latest helper scripts (`create.sh`, `update.sh`) from our installation [page](/installation/docker).

## Config Management Refactoring

The new approach uses `pydantic` models to define the configuration maps. Aside from built-in validation functionality, this approach also allows the automatic generation of JSON schemas which is a big first step in the direction of decoupling the bot from its interface. Another major step in that direction is significantly restricting the use of global variables when dealing with the global config map (now renamed to client config map) and the `AllConnectorSettings` class.

The approach to storing and retrieving secure configs has also been refactored. We no longer store secure configs in the client config map (former global config map). Those are only stored in the `Security` class (which is still unfortunately accessed globally). In addition, the secure values are no longer stored separate from non-secure configs ‚Äî they are both part of the same config map and stored in the same `yaml` file.

## Uniswap v3 LP strategy is back

The existing Uniswap LP connector and strategy has been refactored and is now currently compatible with Gateway v2.
