## Release Highlights

### Gateway Refactor Updates

This release makes substantial progress toward completing the Gateway simplification initiative approved in [HGP-63](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0x5cc3540ee219787d5c842bc1ccdb11aab46203bb7f0be658b6b40858501a8e4c), whichs to streamline Gateway's architecture and improve its maintainability. The refactor establishes a new standard for DEX connectors that significantly reduces complexity while improving performance and developer experience.

**Key Improvements:**

- **Improved Code Modularity**: Reorganized project structure for better developer experience
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Standardized error handling with descriptive messages
- **Standardized Connector Pattern**: Clear pattern for DEX connectors that provide templates for community developers

**Updated Connectors:**

This release updates the **Uniswap** and **Ethereum** connectors to the new simplified standard, serving as reference implementations for future connector development. Additionally, this update completes the refactoring of **Solana DEX connectors** including Jupiter, Raydium, and Meteora.

Now that the refactor is complete, Hummingbot Foundation will publish bounties to refactor other Gateway connectors and review/merge pull requests to add other Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) based DEXs.

**Updated Test Scripts:**

The following scripts have been updated to test the refactored connectors:

- [`amm_data_feed_example.py`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/amm_data_feed_example.py) - Demonstrates real-time price feeds from AMM and CLMM DEXs
- [`amm_trade_example.py`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/amm_trade_example.py) - Triggers a swap when price reaches a certain level on AMM and CLMM DEXs
- [`clmm_manage_position.py`](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/clmm_manage_position.py) - Automatically enter and exit LP positions on CLMM DEXs

Pull Request: [#444](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/444)

**What's Next in v2.7:**

The next release will introduce major improvements to transaction handling and the Hummingbot-Gateway communication interface:

- **Improved Transaction Landing**: Complete control over transaction fees with dynamic adjustment based on network conditions, configurable retry strategies, and enhanced visibility into transaction costs
- **Streamlined Hummingbot-Gateway Inteface**: Unified interaction through a single `GatewayTxHandler`, simplified API with generic methods, and more stateless Gateway architecture for better reliability
- **Better User Experience**: More reliable DEX trade execution, improved transaction success rates, and easier troubleshooting with enhanced monitoring capabilities


### Improved Backtesting Performance

This PR introduces significant performance improvements to the backtesting engine by optimizing timestamp-based lookups. The key changes include:

- Replaced timestamp-based filtering with pandas datetime index lookups in `ExecutorSimulation` class, using `searchsorted` for efficient timestamp lookups (by far the most impactful change)

- Modified `BacktestingEngineBase` to use datetime index for all timestamp operations

- Updated both `DCAExecutorSimulator` and `PositionExecutorSimulator` to use datetime-based slicing instead of timestamp filtering

These changes have resulted in a performance improvement of over 40% in backtesting operations by:

- Eliminating expensive DataFrame filtering operations

- Leveraging pandas' optimized datetime index operations

- Reducing memory usage by avoiding creation of intermediate filtered DataFrames

### Controller Improvements

**Controller Framework & Strategy Enhancements**

- Added global stop-loss, per-strategy leverage support, and automatic position-reduction on opposite signals, giving V2 controllers stronger risk controls.

- This release introduces a new [statistical-arbitrage controller](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/stat_arb.py) that continuously computes hedge ratios and Z-scores, maintains balanced paired orders, and uses live funding-rate data to fine-tune signals‚Äîstreaming real-time metrics like hedge ratio, funding, and pair PnL throughout execution.

- `generic.basic_order_example` simplified (async update loop, dynamic mid-price, lower default leverage)

- Candle helpers and sample scripts updated to showcase the new API surface

**Market Data Upgrades**

- Introduced `MarketDataProvider.get_funding_info()`, exposing real-time funding-rate objects to strategies and scripts‚Äîunlocking funding-aware logic such as that used by `stat_arb`.

**Binance Connector Reliability Improvements** *(Perpetual & Spot)*

- Listen-key lifecycle overhauled: periodic 30-minute keep-alive pings, graceful key cleanup at shutdown, and automatic stream re-opening after errors‚Äîdramatically reducing ‚Äúlisten key expired‚Äù disconnects.

Pull Request: [#7554](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7554)

### New XRPL Connector Guide

We've published a comprehensive guide on using the XRP Ledger (XRPL) connector with Hummingbot. The guide covers:

- Setting up and configuring the XRPL connector
- Understanding XRPL's unique features like auto-bridging and path-finding
- Working with both the native XRP token and issued tokens on XRPL
- Executing trades on XRPL's built-in DEX
- Best practices for market making on XRPL

### Improved MEXC Connector

This release includes significant improvements to the MEXC connector's reliability and stability:

- **Enhanced Listen Key Management**: Improved lifecycle management with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff
- **Better Error Handling**: More resilient connection handling with proper error recovery
- **Resource Cleanup**: Fixed race conditions and ensured proper cleanup on disconnection
- **Improved Stability**: Resolved timing issues with listen key refresh that could cause unexpected disconnections

These improvements make the MEXC connector more reliable for long-running trading sessions and reduce the likelihood of unexpected disconnections.
