```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy.git
cd deploy
bash setup.sh
```

For individual images, exit running containers, pull the latest images, and restart:
```bash
docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
git pull origin master # Hummingbot
git pull origin main # Gateway
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/linux/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights

### Improved backtesting performance

This PR introduces significant performance improvements to the backtesting engine by optimizing timestamp-based lookups. The key changes include:

- Replaced timestamp-based filtering with pandas datetime index lookups in `ExecutorSimulation` class, using `searchsorted` for efficient timestamp lookups (by far the most impactful change)

- Modified `BacktestingEngineBase` to use datetime index for all timestamp operations

- Updated both `DCAExecutorSimulator` and `PositionExecutorSimulator` to use datetime-based slicing instead of timestamp filtering

These changes have resulted in a performance improvement of over 40% in backtesting operations by:

- Eliminating expensive DataFrame filtering operations

- Leveraging pandas' optimized datetime index operations

- Reducing memory usage by avoiding creation of intermediate filtered DataFrames

### Controller Improvements

**Controller framework & strategy enhancements**

- Added global stop-loss, per-strategy leverage support, and automatic position-reduction on opposite signals, giving V2 controllers stronger risk controls.

- This release introduces a new [statistical-arbitrage controller](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/stat_arb.py) that continuously computes hedge ratios and Z-scores, maintains balanced paired orders, and uses live funding-rate data to fine-tune signals‚Äîstreaming real-time metrics like hedge ratio, funding, and pair PnL throughout execution.

- `generic.basic_order_example` simplified (async update loop, dynamic mid-price, lower default leverage)

- Candle helpers and sample scripts updated to showcase the new API surface

**Market-data Upgrades**

- Introduced `MarketDataProvider.get_funding_info()`, exposing real-time funding-rate objects to strategies and scripts‚Äîunlocking funding-aware logic such as that used by `stat_arb`.

**Binance connector reliability** *(Perpetual & Spot)*

- Listen-key lifecycle overhauled: periodic 30-minute keep-alive pings, graceful key cleanup at shutdown, and automatic stream re-opening after errors‚Äîdramatically reducing ‚Äúlisten key expired‚Äù disconnects.
