# Hummingbot v1.24.0 Release Notes

*Released on January 29, 2024*

## Introduction

We are thrilled to present the latest update, Hummingbot version 1.24.0, as we step into a new year full of possibilities. This release is packed with substantial enhancements, including the introduction of fresh DEX connectors: `Vega Protocol` and `QuipuSwap`, ensuring a broader range of trading opportunities. We've also implemented crucial bug fixes for both the Gateway and the Hummingbot client, enhancing stability and performance.

A major highlight of this version is the significant upgrade to our controllers, particularly with the integration of the `Dmanv4` controller for advanced market making. Furthermore, we're excited to announce a substantial update in the configurability of `v2 strategies`. Users can now customize these strategies by adding configurations to the scripts via a new folder under `conf/scripts`, similar to how strategy configurations are managed under `conf/strategies`.

As we embark on this new year, we remain dedicated to continuously improving Hummingbot, committed to providing our users with superior trading tools and experiences. Let's make this year a remarkable journey together!

## New DEX Connector: Vega Protocol

[Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz/), is built from the ground up using high performing, purpose-built smart contracts specifically for trading - meaning no fees on orders, and fairness at its core. It operates the Vega Alpha Mainnet, which is a Tindermint based blockchain.

For more information, see [Vega](../exchanges/vega.md) in our exchange connector documentation.
