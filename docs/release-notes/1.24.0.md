# Hummingbot v1.24.0 Release Notes

*Released on January 29, 2024*

## Introduction

We are thrilled to present the latest update, Hummingbot version 1.24.0, as we step into a new year full of possibilities. This release is packed with substantial enhancements, including the introduction of fresh DEX connectors: `Vega Protocol` and `QuipuSwap`, ensuring a broader range of trading opportunities. We've also implemented crucial bug fixes for both the Gateway and the Hummingbot client, enhancing stability and performance.

A major highlight of this version is the significant upgrade to our controllers, particularly with the integration of the `Dmanv4` controller for advanced market making. Furthermore, we're excited to announce a substantial update in the configurability of `v2 strategies`. Users can now customize these strategies by adding configurations to the scripts via a new folder under `conf/scripts`, similar to how strategy configurations are managed under `conf/strategies`.

As we embark on this new year, we remain dedicated to continuously improving Hummingbot, committed to providing our users with superior trading tools and experiences. Let's make this year a remarkable journey together!

## V2 Strategies

This release introduces enhancements to strategy scripting and configuration with the addition of new controllers, such as `DMan v4`, `BollingerV1` and `TrendFollowerV1`, and the adaptation of existing scripts with configurations. It enables the initialization of connectors in the scripts using market variables based on user configurations. This version also addresses issues in the script strategy base, focusing on simplifying the start of markets. Users can test these changes by creating configurations for the scripts and running the configured scripts in the Hummingbot terminal. This represents a significant step in improving the flexibility and usability of strategy scripts in Hummingbot.

For more information see our [V2 Strategies guide](../v2-strategies/index.md)
