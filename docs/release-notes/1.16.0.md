# Release Notes - Version 1.16.0

*Released on May 29, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the May 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.16.0) today!

This release adds new connectors for [Foxbit](/exchanges/foxbit), [Phemex Perpetual](/exchanges/phemex-perpetual), [Tinyman](/exchanges/tinyman) on the [Algorand](/chains/algorand) blockchain, and introduces overall improvements to the bot as well as the new Hummingbot Strategy Performance Dashboard! 

With this release, users no longer need to download a separate Docker image for `ARM` builds. Hummingbot now offers a multi-arch Docker image that supports both `x86` and `arm64` architectures.

!!! Important
    This release brings a substantial number of enhancements to the Hummingbot database. As a result, we strongly recommend a fresh installation of Hummingbot. If you are updating from a previous version, we highly advise backing up, archiving, or deleting the existing sqlite file located in the conf/data folder. Failure to do so may result in errors upon startup. Also, please note that the updated Hummingbot Dashboard is only compatible with version 1.16.0 and above.

## Download Candles Script Improvements

**Pull Request:** [#6289](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6289)

We improved the [Download Candles script](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/download_candles.py) by incorporating the capacity to download data across various intervals, thereby allowing simultaneous access to multiple timeframes. 

## New Script Examples

This release added the following new [Script](/scripts) examples:

- [1overN_portfolio](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/1overN_portfolio.py): This strategy aims to create a 1/N cryptocurrency portfolio, providing perfect diversification without parametrization and giving a reasonable baseline performance.

- [spot_perp_arb](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/spot_perp_arb.py):  This script improves upon and addresses problems with the current [spot perp arbitrage](/strategies/spot-perpetual-arbitrage) strategy. It is designed to simultaneously initiate a long position in the spot market and a short position in the perpetual market when the opening signal is triggered. These positions are then closed upon receiving the closing signal. The profit is generated from the corrective motion between the spot price and the perpetual price.


## Supprted Order Types (Connectors)

**Pull Request:** [#6279](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6279), [#6305](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6305), [#6308](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6308)

Aligning with our [Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/) for 2023, we are expanding our support to include all order types. In this recent release, we have initiated the integration of `market_order` and `limit_maker_order` types for our Gold and Silver exchanges, namely [Binance](/exchanges/binance), [Gate.io Perpetual](/exchanges/gate-io-perpetual), and [dydx](/exchanges/dydx-perpetual).

## Docker improvements

**Pull Request:** [#6229](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6229), [#6297](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6297)

This was aimed at streamlining the installation process and Docker workflow of the Hummingbot project. As part of this initiative, all platform-specific `environment.yml` files were eliminated, leaving behind only a single `environment.yml` file in the `setup` folder. The `install.sh` script was also updated as part of these changes, and it now uses the same `environment.yml` file to ensure a unified setup process.

The Docker image can now be built using a simple command for multiple architectures, making it more accessible across a range of systems, including `x86` and `ARM` architectures. To complement these changes, a new `docker-compose.yml` file was introduced, which requires the specification of the full path and is compatible with the new Dockerfile. These modifications are expected to enhance the overall user experience by simplifying the setup process and making Hummingbot more adaptable across a wide range of systems.
