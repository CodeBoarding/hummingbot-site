# Release Notes - Version 1.16.0

*Released on May 29, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the May 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.16.0) today!

This release adds new connectors for Foxbit, Phemex Perpetual, Tinyman on the Algorand blockchain, and introduces improvements to the new Hummingbot Strategy Performance Dashboard!
With this release, users no longer need to download individual Docker images for `ARM` builds. Hummingbot now offers a multi-arch Docker image that supports both `x86` and `arm64` architectures.
