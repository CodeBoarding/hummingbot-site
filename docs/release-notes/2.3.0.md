## Release Highlights

### Ongoing Refactor of Gateway DEX Connectors

With the exponential rise of DEX trading in recent months on Solana, the Gateway middleware needed to be refactored to support Solana DEXs, enable Concentrated Liquidity Market Making (CLMM) strategies, and modernize the tech stack. This is a multi-month effort to improve the Gateway middleware and make it more efficient, secure, and easier to maintain. See [NCP-22](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0x5cc3540ee219787d5c842bc1ccdb11aab46203bb7f0be658b6b40858501a8e4c) for more details.

In this release, we have streamlined the Gateway codebase to focus on two chain architectures: Solana and Ethereum. Ethereum L2 networks like Base along with EVM-compatible chains like Avalanche, Polygon, and BSC are now handled by the Ethereum chain connector, while Solana and other SVM-compatible chains are handled by the Solana chain connector. We have also refactored the Uniswap DEX connector to use this new Ethereum class and added a Jupiter DEX connector on Solana.

As part of the Gateway refactor, we've upgraded the underlying web framework from Express to Fastify. This modernization brings several key benefits including automatic OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation for all API endpoints, significantly improved performance compared to Express, built-in request Typescript validation.

In the next release, we plan to add support for Meteora and Raydium as CLMM DEX connectors on Solana, and enhance the Uniswap connector with LP functionality. The Gateway middleware will standardize CLMM endpoints across all supported DEXs to provide a unified interface for liquidity provision. We will also publish comprehensive documentation to help the community migrate their custom DEX connectors to the new Gateway architecture.

Check out one of our recent weekly Youtube livestream demo to see the new Meteora connector in action!

Pull Requests: [Hummingbot - #7367](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7367) | [Gateway -#380](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/pull/380) 


### New Cross-Exchange Market Making (XEMM) V2 Controller

This release introduces a new V2-compatible version of the Cross Exchange Market Making (XEMM) strategy, one of Hummingbot's original core strategies. The new implementation provides users with greater flexibility and control over their market making activities across different exchanges. Users can now configure multiple order levels, monitor performance through Dashboard, and run multiple XEMM instances concurrently.

See the [`xemm_multiple_levels` controller](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/xemm_multiple_levels.py) for the new implementation, which can be initialized with the `v2_with_controllers` script like other V2 controllers.

Pull Request: [Hummingbot #7369](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7369)

### New GridStrike V2 Controller

This release also introduces a new strategy, `GridStrike`, that combines aspects of grid trading, market making, and directional trading into a single advanced strategy. It allows users to maintain a grid of buy and sell orders around the current price of an asset with inventory-based risk management.

See the [`grid_strike` controller](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/grid_strike.py) for the new implementation, which can be initialized with the `v2_with_controllers` script like other V2 controllers.

### New BingX Spot Connector

This release adds support for BingX spot markets in [Hummingbot #7280](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7280). This [proposal](https://snapshot.box/#/s:hbot-ncp.eth/proposal/0xac46cb41a8f66e7cb13f99471da7c8d1bd2c47f81e3743be60e667638e4ac436) was submitted by [Robotter Labs](https://labs.robotter.ai) in collaboration with BingX, aiming to enhance Hummingbot's capabilities by integrating BingX Exchange. See the [BingX](../exchanges/bing_x/index.md) documentation for more information.

Bitmart is a leading global digital asset trading platform that provides spot and derivatives trading services to over 9 million users worldwide When you run Hummingbot on Bitmart, a portion of your trading fees automatically goes to support the Foundation at no additional cost to you.

This release adds support for a Bitmart perpetual connector in [Hummingbot #7368](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/7368) with the [bounty](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/issues/7323), funded by the Bitmart team.
