!!! note
    The [Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard), [Backend-API](https://github.com/hummingbot/backend-api), and [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) repositories will now follow a continuous deployment model without fixed version releases. This approach allows for more frequent updates and improved maintainability of these components.

## How to Update

### Docker

Re-run the [Deploy](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) setup script:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy.git
cd deploy
bash setup.sh
```

For individual images, exit running containers, pull the latest images, and restart:
```bash
docker compose down
docker pull hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
docker compose up -d
```

### Source

Update the branches of each repo to this release by running:
```bash
git pull origin master # Hummingbot
git pull origin main # Gateway
```

Afterwards, follow the instructions to re-install dependencies and compile the codebase for each repository. See [Install Hummingbot from Source](/installation/linux/) and [Install Gateway from Source](/gateway/installation).

## Release Highlights


### Gateway Core Refactor & Enhancements

Hummingbot Gateway has undergone a major refactor to improve efficiency, standardization, and maintainability. This update simplifies API interactions, enhances security, and introduces better support for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum and Solana. The refactor ensures seamless integration with Hummingbot while allowing for standalone usage with improved debugging and configuration tools.  

Key improvements include:  

- Refactored Gateway Middleware ‚Äì Cleaner and more modular architecture for easier maintenance and expansion.  

- Unified API Endpoints ‚Äì Standardized API responses across EVM-based chains and Solana, simplifying integration with Hummingbot.  

- Enhanced Arbitrage Trading ‚Äì Improved support for executing arbitrage trades between centralized and decentralized exchanges, with optimized fee estimation and slippage management.  

- Solana Fee Optimization ‚Äì Dynamic gas fee adjustments based on network conditions, allowing for more cost-efficient transaction execution.  

- DEX Connector Updates ‚Äì Initial support for Uniswap (Ethereum) and Jupiter (Solana), with plans to expand to other DEXs such as Meteora.  

- Improved Security & Performance ‚Äì Migration to `fastify` for better API handling, faster execution, and increased reliability.  

- Standalone & Hummingbot Integration ‚Äì Can be run independently for testing and debugging or integrated seamlessly with Hummingbot.  

- Error Handling & Debugging Enhancements ‚Äì Improved transaction tracking, nonce management for EVM chains, and better response visibility via Postman or Swagger UI.  

**Planned Future Enhancements:**  

- Support for additional DEXs beyond Uniswap and Jupiter.  

- Further optimization of slippage tolerance and transaction execution logic.  

- Expanded documentation and testing frameworks for improved usability.  

This update lays the groundwork for a more scalable and reliable Gateway, making it easier to interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems while improving arbitrage and market-making efficiency. üöÄ
