We are very excited to ship the February 2023 Hummingbot release (v1.13.0) today! See below for the highlights in this release.

## Gateway UX improvements

We've removed Gateway from within the Hummingbot repo and instead created it's own repo here - <https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway>
For developers that wish to contribute to Gateway please make sure the PR is pointing to the correct repo above. We will be updating the documentation soon with instructions on how to install Gateway using the new repo.

- [6092](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6092) Removed the gateway `start`, `stop` and `create` commands since the new setup is different

> Changes are the following:
>
>   1. Improved Dockerfile:

>     - Add certs path
>     - Create certs path on the gateway
>
>   2. Commands
>     - Generate certs is now creating the certs by default under the Certs folder of Hummingbot.

>     - Client: create the certs folder
>     - Gateway: remove all unnecessary questions and add logic to copy existing certs. Forward port of docs too.

## Developer Updates

[6026](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6026) Added the smart component `"Position executor"`

> - This component receives as input the strategy and the `PositionConfig`, which is a new data type that includes the information needed to start a directional position in perpetuals following the logic of the triple barrier method.
> - For now, the component is controlled by the strategy by calling the method control position every tick, but is going to be improved by creating an async task that is going to execute this process until the executor is done.
> - Requires the `pandas_ta` dependency. See [6051](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6051)

[6046](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6046) Added Candles feed
  
> - Add candles data feed for Binance Spot and Binance Perpetuals. A base class is provided to add more candlesticks providers and a `CandlesFactory` is also included to simplify the creation of the candlesticks.

> - This module will allow traders to use technical indicators to code directional strategies.

> - Added custom script to visualize with `status --live` the candlesticks [candlesticks_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/candlesticks_example.py)

[6066](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6066) Added the ability for Hummingbot to autostart scripts

> - Users can now pass the parameter `--config-file-name={script_name}.py` for the script to autostart

[6093](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6093) Added two directional script examples
  
> - Simple directional strategy: trades in ETH-USDT using the RSI of 1m candles.

> - Advanced directional strategy: trades ETH-USDT using RSI and BBANDS of 1m and 3m candles.

> - Explanation of the two scripts is in this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X63rACPjtUE>
