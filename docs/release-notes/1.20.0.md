## V2 Strategy Framework

Hummingbot's V2 Strategy Framework is officially released!

The new [V2 Strategy Framework](/v2-strategies) significantly expands Hummingbot's capabilities, allowing users to create modular, backtestable, and sophisticated strategies. Unlike the monolithic V1 strategies, V2 Strategies are designed to be highly adaptable, allowing seamless integration of various components. Whether you're a technical expert or a trading novice, you can easily create, backtest, and deploy strategies via [Dashboard](/dashboard).

We're introducing specialized templates for different trading paradigms, including Market Making, Directional, and future strategy types. These new strategy templates allow users to combine different composable components:

* Candles: These structure both historical and real-time market data into OHLCV format, generating refined signals for trading decisions.
* Controllers: These orchestrate the overall strategy, deciding which Executors to deploy or adjust based on signals generated by Candles.
* Executors: These are the operational elements that handle precise trade execution, adapt to market changes, and manage the order lifecycle.

## New Dashboard Features

!!! warning "Under Active Development"
    Dashboard is still under active development. If you're excited to explore its initial capabilities, you can find the first version [here](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard).

The **Bot Orchestration** section enables you to effortlessly deploy and manage multiple instances of Hummingbot. Key updates include:

- **Master Bot Credentials**: Now you can use a single set of credentials to manage all your bot instances, streamlining the setup process.  
- **Enhanced Bot Status Formatting**: We've added a specialized parser that neatly formats the status of running bots, making it easier to monitor their activity.

The **Backtest Manager** section is designed to help you fine-tune your trading strategies using historical data. This month, we started to add the initial components, including integration with the Optuna optimization framework and minimal versions of the initial pages.

Watch this video to see how to deploy Dashboard on AWS:

It's important to note that the Hummingbot Dashboard is currently in its beta phase, which means new features and improvements are being added continuously. While the Dashboard offers a variety of functionalities, it is not yet a polished, finalized product. We highly encourage user feedback at this stage; your insights can greatly help us fine-tune the Dashboard's capabilities and user experience. Feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on Discord or Github.

## Hummingbot Library

We are excited to announce that Hummingbot is now available as a [**Python library**](https://pypi.org/project/hummingbot/), making it easier than ever to integrate and deploy! Simply use the command `pip install hummingbot` to get started. By becoming available as a library, Hummingbot offers users the following benefits:

- **Simplified Installation:** With just a single command, users can seamlessly install Hummingbot without going through complex setup processes.
- **Improved Integration:** Developers can now easily integrate Hummingbot functionalities into their applications, expanding its use cases.
- **Enhanced Portability:** Being a library allows for easier distribution and deployment across various platforms and environments.
- **Version Control:** Users can effortlessly manage and update to specific versions of Hummingbot using pip's built-in features.
- **Community Contributions:** As a library, it‚Äôs simpler for the community to contribute to the code, leading to faster improvements and feature additions.

## Update Cython version to 3.0

This upgrade not only brings in the latest features and bug fixes from Cython but also ensures that Hummingbot remains backward compatible, offering a seamless experience to its users. Here are some of the benefits of this update:

**Enhanced Stability:** The update modifies the `environment.yml` dependencies to upgrade Cython to the latest 3.0 version. This transition from the alpha version ensures that Hummingbot benefits from the latest bug fixes, enhancing the overall stability of the platform.

**New Functionalities:** With the introduction of Cython 3.0, the community can now leverage new functionalities. Specifically, it becomes possible to generate a compiled Cythonized version of a pure Python module by merely adding some Cython decorators to classes or functions.

**Backward Compatibility:** To ensure that existing `.pyx` files in the project, which include standard Python type hinting, remain compatible, a compiler configuration "annotation_typing": False was added. This is because, by default, Cython version 3 expects developers to use Cython type hinting.
