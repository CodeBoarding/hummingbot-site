## New Strategy: Funding Rate Arbitrage

<iframe style="width:100%; min-height:400px;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ly8R5g3juxw?si=bW_5vralw6zZd-0s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The new [**Funding Rate Arbitrage**](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/funding_rate_arb.py) sample script works by exploiting differences in funding rates across different cryptocurrency exchanges to make a profit. 

It evaluates the current funding rates across all configured connectors for the specified tokens. The script calculates the profitability of entering trades based on the difference in these rates and compares it against a profitability threshold set in the configuration.

## New Strategy: Cross Exchange Market Making (XEMM)

[XEMM Executor](../v2-strategies/executors/xemm-executor.md) is a new **Strategy V2 component**  which is designed to handle cross-exchange market making (XEMM) operations within the Hummingbot framework. 

You can use the [v2_xemm.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/v2_xemm.py) script to run it. We have also added a Controller version taht supports multiple order levels: [xemm_multiple_levels.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/controllers/generic/xemm_multiple_levels.py).

**Pull Request:**  [#6946](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6946)

## Updated Docker Installation Process

We have simplified and updated the [Docker installation](/installation/docker) instructions so that users can install from the base Hummingbot Github repo. This change aims to enhance user experience by providing a more organized and straightforward approach to using Hummingbot's powerful features.

The page includes [advanced configuration examples ](/installation/docker/#advanced-configurations) as well that were previously hosted in the `deploy-examples` repo, which now features a single, comprehensive deployment example designed to launch multiple bots efficiently.

## New CEX Connector: Cube Exchange

[Cube Exchange](https://www.cube.exchange/) is an MPC-based exchange that boasts high security & low latency when trading. It is being built by a team around ex-Solana engineer Bartosz Lipinski and aims to be the slickest trading experience the crypto space has ever seen.

This connector has been developed by the **Robotter.ai** team, most notably **Wojak**, who put in a massive effort to deliver a high-quality integration of Cube into Hummingbot.
