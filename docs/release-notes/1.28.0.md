## Hummingbot 2.0 Preview

The next release, Hummingbot 2.0, will be a massive overhaul of the Hummingbot framework. No longer just a command line tool, you can now use the Hummingbot Dashboard application to create, backtest, and deploy strategies. Backtesting is available for Directional and Market Making [Controllers].

For users that want to test it out, we recommend use the [https://github.com/cardosofede/hummingbot-deploy](https://github.com/cardosofede/hummingbot-deploy) repo. By running `bash setup.sh` script, you will launches Dashboard, Backend API, as well as the Brokers repo as Docker containers. Since this is still currently in beta, we welcome any feedback you may have and please let us know on Discord if you encounter any issues. 

## Consensus2024 Launch Event

During the Consensus2024 conference, we held a [launch event](https://lu.ma/ieyvhcft) to give the commununity an early look at Hummingbot 2.0. We demonstrated how you can use Hummingbot Dashboard to construct, backtestm and deploy powerful market making strategies. The event recording will soon be posted to the [Hummingbot YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/hummingbot).
