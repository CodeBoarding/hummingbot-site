## Refactored Backtesting 

Backtesting now supports directional and market - making strategies and users can now use it to generate configurations, backtest them and deploy the configuration all from the dashboard!

For users that want to test it out the recommended approach is to use this repo [https://github.com/cardosofede/hummingbot-deploy](https://github.com/cardosofede/hummingbot-deploy) as it launches Dashboard, Backend-API as well as the Brokers as Docker containers in one single Compose file. Since this is still currently in beta, we welcome any feedback you have and also please let us know if you encounter any issues.
