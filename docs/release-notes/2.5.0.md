## Release Highlights

### Conda Environment Upgrade

The latest update upgrades Hummingbot's core environment to **Python 3.12**, bringing performance improvements and modern language features. The Conda environment has been streamlined to rely primarily on Conda packages, simplifying setup and maintenance. 

Key libraries, including **Pydantic**, have been updated for better performance and compatibility. Additionally, test suites now utilize Python's **asyncio** framework, enhancing testing efficiency and reliability.

### Market Making Controller and Position Hold

The latest release introduces a new V2 feature: **PositionsHeld**, which tracks a global set of spot balances and perpetual positions held by stopped executors. This includes the amounts held for each asset and the unrealized P&L of each position. It also enables controllers to call `StopExecutorAction` with `keep_position=true` to maintain positions after stopping execution.

This release also adds a new **Market Making Controller**, a pure market-making strategy that leverages the PositionsHeld feature to manage inventory skew more effectively.

### Gateway Refactor

The 2.5 release introduces new Gateway connectors for Solana-based DEXs, including `Jupiter`, `Raydium`, and `Meteora`, along with updated schemas supporting `Swap`, `AMM`, and `CLMM` connector types. This version also includes new test scripts to validate these connectors. In the next release (2.6.0), users can expect the addition of the `GatewayAMM` and `GatewayCLMM` classes. 

For installation, refer to the [New Gateway](../gateway/installation.md) if you're using Solana DEX connectors, or the [Legacy Gateway](../gateway/legacy/installation.md) if you need compatibility with older connectors.
