# Release Notes - Version 1.19.0

*Released on August 28, 2023*

We're thrilled to announce the launch of Hummingbot's August 2023 release (v1.19.0)! This update introduces an advanced arbitrage component, an enhanced fixed grid script building upon the previous strategy, and the migration of the **Injective** connectors to a pure Python interface. This means they no longer need Gateway, but it also brings support for delegated accounts. Additionally, for Gateway, we've integrated a brand-new connector, **Plenty**, rooted in the **Tezos** blockchain."

## New Script Examples

This release adds a script version of the original Fixed Grid Strategy by community member `jamesPMagic` Check out the demo video of this script as well below!

- [fixed_grid.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/fixed_grid.py): The script implements a fixed grid trading strategy, placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, rebalancing assets if required, and providing status updates on trades and balances. **Pull Request:** [#6495](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6495)

- [wallet_hedge_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/wallet_hedge_example.py): The script implements a fixed grid trading strategy, placing buy and sell orders at predetermined price levels, rebalancing assets if required, and providing status updates on trades and balances. **Pull Request:** [#6495](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6496)

- [arbitrage_with_smart_component.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/arbitrage_with_smart_component.py): The script defines an `ArbitrageWithSmartComponent` class that automates cryptocurrency arbitrage trading between CEX / DEX exchanges, ensuring sufficient balances and managing active and closed arbitrage executions. 

## New Chain/DEX Connectors: Tezos/Plenty

[Tezos](https://tezos.com/)  is a self-amending, decentralized blockchain platform with on-chain governance, emphasizing formal verification for smart contracts and utilizing a liquid proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. [Plenty](https://plenty.network/), is a leading decentralized exchange and automated market maker (Dex & AMM) on the Tezos blockchain.

See [Tezos](/chains/tezos) for the chain docs and the [Plenty](/exchanges/plenty) exchange connector docs.

## Migration of Injective connectors to pure Python

Implementation of a pure Python (no gateway required) Injective spot and perpetual markets connector to be used with delegated accounts. Delegated accounts means that the user will have the funds in one account (known as portfolio account or granter account) but all trading messages and transactions sent to the chain will be signed with a different account (known as the trading account or grantee account). With the new connector the user can have many Hummingbot instances trading using the same funds (the same portfolio account) but with a different trading account for each bot, ensuring that each Hummingbot instance will use independent accounts when sending transactions to the chain, and hence independent sequence numbers (eliminating with this the sequence number mismatch issues).

## New Arbitrage Smart Component

This release introduces a new component in Hummingbot called the `ArbitrageExecutor`. This component is designed to automate the process of arbitrage trading. It contains logic to determine the profitability of an arbitrage opportunity, place buy and sell orders on different exchanges or trading pairs, and monitor the status of these orders. The component also provides a formatted status of the arbitrage execution, including details like profitability and transaction costs. Additionally, various data types related to the arbitrage executor are defined, such as trading pairs on exchanges, arbitrage configurations, and the status of the arbitrage execution.

**Pull Requests:** [#6505](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6505)

This PR also includes a script that uses the arbitrage component which users can test out - 

- [arbitrage_with_smart_component.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/arbitrage_with_smart_component.py): The script defines an `ArbitrageWithSmartComponent` class that automates cryptocurrency arbitrage trading between CEX / DEX exchanges, ensuring sufficient balances and managing active and closed arbitrage executions.
