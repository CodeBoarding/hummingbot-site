# Release Notes - Version 1.19.0

*Released on August 28, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the August 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.19.0) today! This release features a significant upgrade to **Python 3.10**, providing enhanced performance and reliability for users. In Gateway, the **Uniswap** connector now supports fetching prices directly from pools, which lowers latency and resolves past issues. In addition, we added Candles Feeds and Market Orders support to the **Ascendex** connector, as well as a new DEX connector to **Vertex**!
