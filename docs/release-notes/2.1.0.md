## Hummingbot 2.0.2 Highlights

## New Dexalot Connector (Python)

This PR enhances the current **Dexalot** API connector by transitioning it to a fully Python-based implementation, eliminating the need for the **Hummingbot Gateway**. Users can now utilize the XRPL connector similarly to a standard CEX connector by executing the `connect dexalot` command. This upgrade significantly boosts the connector's performance and enhances stability for user trading activities.
