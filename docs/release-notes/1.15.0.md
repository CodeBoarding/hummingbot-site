## Candles Feed Improvements

**Pull Request:** [#6190](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6190)

We improved the [CandlesFeed](/scripts/candles-feed) Smart Component introduced in the last release. Specifically, we improved the collection of candles via REST to allow processing of WebSocket messages while the fill historical candles task is collecting the missing candles via REST.

## New Script Examples

- [download_candles.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/scripts/download_candles.py): This script provides an example of how to use the Candles Feed to download and store historical data. It downloads 3-minute candles for 3 Binance trading pairs ["APE-USDT", "BTC-USDT", "BNB-USDT"] and stores them in CSV files in the /data directory. The script stops after it has downloaded 175,000 max_records records for each pair

- [pmm_with_shifted_mid_dynamic_spreads.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/tree/master/scripts/pmm_with_shifted_mid_dynamic_spreads.py): This script will demonstrate how to extend the simple mmm example to shift the mid-price and make the spreads dynamic by using the candles component and applying technical indicators.
