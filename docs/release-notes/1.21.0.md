    Dashboard is slated for incorporation into official Hummingbot releases before end of this year, but it is still under active development and new features and improvements are being added continuously. We highly encourage user feedback at this stage; feel free to share your thoughts and suggestions on Discord or Github. If you're excited to explore its capabilities, check out the [beta](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard).


### Streamlit Authentication

Implemented authentication functionality within the Streamlit framework, ensuring that users are required to log in to access the dashboard, thereby enhancing security. This authentication can be enabled / disabled depending on the user preference.

### Refactored Trading Pair Fetcher

* Added a new configuration variable `fetch_pairs_from_all_exchanges` in `conf_client.yml`, which is set to `False` by default.
* Updated the trading pair fetcher so that when the new variable is `False`, pairs are fetched **only** from exchanges with a `user-added API key`, plus exchanges in `paper_trade_exchanges` in `conf_client.yml`.
* If the variable is `True`, pairs are fetched from all exchange connectors, maintaining the previous behavior.
* A `fetch_all` operation is triggered after a user adds an API key to fetch pairs from the newly connected exchange
