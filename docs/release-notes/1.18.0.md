# Release Notes - Version 1.18.0

*Released on July 24, 2023*

We are very excited to ship the July 2023 release of Hummingbot (v1.18.0) today!

This release introduces a significant update to the Hummingbot environment, featuring an upgrade to Python version 3.10. Users can anticipate enhanced performance speed and a decrease in memory leaks. For the Gateway component, we've introduced a feature that allows direct interaction with the pool in the Uniswap connector. This aims to resolve certain issues previously encountered with Uniswap, thereby improving both performance and stability. 

For exchanges, we improved support for Silver-tier CEX **Ascendex** by adding Candles Feeds and Market Orders support, as well as a new DEX connector - **Vertex**!

## Hummingbot Dashboard Updates

The [Hummingbot Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard) is an innovative **community-driven project**. Its primary objective is to serve as a **comprehensive graphical interface** that simplifies the process of deploying and managing multiple Hummingbot instances.

This release empowers users with the ability to create Hummingbot instances, as well as initiate and terminate them directly from the Dashboard. Additionally, users can select a configuration file within the Dashboard itself. The strategy performance page has also been enhanced to utilize market data from the database table, thereby improving the rendering of the OHLC with this data.

For more information on what's being currently worked on, see the [Dashboard Backlog](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/14) as well as the [Wiki](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard/wiki) where you can see the current tasks being worked on as well as the contributors assigned. You can also follow the progress in the **#dashboard** channel in Discord.

## New Features for Ascendex

This release adds additional features for Ascendex, which the community used HBOT governance to prioritze as a Silver-tier connector for Epoch 4.

[Candles Feed](/scripts/candles-feed/) helps you generate custom OHLCV candles using both historical and live Websocket data, and create real-time custom technical indicators using `pandas_ta`.

You can now use the following connectors:

- `ascendex`
- `kucoin`
- `gate_io`
- `gate_io_perpetual`

For example:
```python
candles = [CandlesFactory.get_candle(connector=ascendex,
           trading_pair="ETH-USDT", interval="1m", max_records=100)]
```

Following our [Technical Roadmap](https://blog.hummingbot.org/technical-roadmap-2023/), we are expanding our connectors to support to include all order types offered by an exchange. In this release, we integrated the `market_order` type for [Ascendex](/exchanges/ascendex).

## New script examples

This release adds a couple directional strategies including a script example to test the newly added DEX data feed.

- [amm_data_feed_example.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/amm_data_feed_example.py): This is a script example using two DEX data feeds of different 
networks **Pull Request:** [#6477](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6477)

- [directional_strategy_trend_follower.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/directional_strategy_trend_follower.py): This is a trend following strategy. **Pull Request:** [#6415](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6415)

- [directional_strategy_widening_ema_bands.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/directional_strategy_widening_ema_bands.py): This strategy uses two EMAs one short and one long to generate trading signals and execute trades based on the percentage of distance between them. **Pull Request:** [#6390](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/pull/6390)
