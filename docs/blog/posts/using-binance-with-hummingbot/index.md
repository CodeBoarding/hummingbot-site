## Generate API Keys

Before you start, please make sure you complete your Binance account verification. Binance allows API key creation only for accounts that have completed their Basic and Intermediate Verification. If you haven't completed both of your account's Basic and Intermediate verification procedures, kindly go back to Binance and complete it. Once your account is verified, you will be able to complete the steps.


**Step 1**

Log in to your Binance account. Click on your **Profile** icon, and then on the right-hand sidebar, click [API Management](https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management)

**Step 2**

Click **Create API**. Please note that before creating an API Key, you need to:

   - Enable [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/account-functions?c=1&navId=1#11) on your account.
   - Make a deposit of any amount to activate your account.

**Step 6**

Your API Key has now been created. **Save your API Key and Secret Key securely**. If you lose your Secret Key, you'll need to delete this API Key and create a new one.

Under **API restrictions**, ensure you select:

   - **Enable Spot & Margin Trading** if trading on Spot markets.

   - **Enable Futures** if trading Perpetuals.


Under **IP access restrictions**, you have two options:

   - **Unrestricted** - not recommended

   - **Restrict access to trusted IPs only** (Recommended) - enter the public IP address of the machine Hummingbot is running on
