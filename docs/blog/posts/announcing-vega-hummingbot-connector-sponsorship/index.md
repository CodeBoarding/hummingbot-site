# Announcing the Vega Protocol Connector and Sponsorship

![](cover.png)

With the release of a new [connector guide](/academy-content/using-vega-protocol-with-hummingbot) for the Vega DEX connector, we are thriled to officially welcome [Vega Protocol](https://vega.xyz) as an sponsor and partner of Hummingbot Foundation! 

As an open source foundation dedicated to democratizing algo trading, we partner with like-minded crypto organizations. We've known the Vega founding team for several years now and we share their commitment to decentralization and permissionless trading. That's why we're excited to announce Vega Protocol as a new Hummingbot Foundation [sponsor](/about/sponsors), which will support us in maintaining the Vega connector and educating our communities on how to use it!

> “We are really excited that the Hummingbot community has embraced Vega, especially because both projects share a very strong core belief in democratizing trading and so we have a philosophical alignment as well as a technical one.” — Barney Mannerings, Co-Founder of Vega Protocol

## Sponsorship Details

Over the next few months, we plan to work with Vega Protocol to help new users successfully create and deploy trading algorithms on the Vega connector, with activities such as:

* Maintaining, updating, and documenting the Vega connector
* Creating connector guides and demo videos
* Running bots on Vega and analyzing their performance
* Designing custom dashboards and screeners for Vega

For instance, we just released the [Vega Connector Guide](/academy-content/using-vega-protocol-with-hummingbot), in which we detail creating a Vega wallet, adding credentials to Hummingbot, and running scripts.
