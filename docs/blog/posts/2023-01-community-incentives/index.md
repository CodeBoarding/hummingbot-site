# Community Incentives

![](./community-word-cloud.jpg)

The Community Incentives program was launched on December 12, 2022 with the aim to foster active participation and problem-solving among members in Discord channels. During its 7-week trial period, it was exhilarating to observe a significant number of users earning HBOT rewards for providing valuable responses to community questions.

> The level of engagement and support demonstrated by the members was exceptional, and we are overjoyed to express our deep gratitude to our top three contributors: SoothsayerX, MementoMori, and random-dude, who served as inspiring models of devotion and commitment. We also recognize and extend our appreciation to other noteworthy contributors such as ctraderxt, hbminerfan, wojak, Lawnel, JOE, yancong, and Lazydayz137.

Over the 7-week trial period, the community generated a total of 618 responses, earning a combined total of 945 points and rewarding 350,000 HBOT as incentives. This is an outstanding achievement and we eagerly anticipate seeing more community engagement in the upcoming months as we progress on our technical and governance roadmaps throughout this year.

Based on these impressive results, we have proposed 2 million HBOT rewards to continue the Community Incentives for the next 12 months. This will include a weekly cycle of 80,000 HBOT to be distributed, with a maximum of 12,000 HBOT that any participant can earn.

We strongly encourage our community members to help cast their vote on this proposal as it will greatly impact both our new and existing users by providing more support and assistance with their questions and challenges encountered as they navigate the Hummingbot ecosystem.

Finally, we would like to extend an invitation to more members of the community to join this program and bring in a diverse range of perspectives, experiences, and skills that can benefit us all.
