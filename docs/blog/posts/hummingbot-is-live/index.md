# Hummingbot is Live!

![](cover.png)

**Welcome to decentralized market making.**

Hummingbot is now public and open-source, and we‚Äôre beyond excited to bring this high-frequency market making trading bot to the masses.

The software is currently available on our [Github](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) and [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/hummingbot/hummingbot).

### What is Hummingbot?

Hummingbot is an open-source software client that allows users to create and customize automated, algorithmic trading bots for making markets on both centralized and decentralized digital asset exchanges.

Now, anyone can be a high-frequency trader and earn profits from market making, a trading strategy that was previously accessible only to algorithmic hedge funds. For our exchange partners, Hummingbot solves their liquidity challenges by turning their community into a decentralized army of market makers.

While Hummingbot is not the first publicly-available trading bot (in fact, we reviewed several), it was designed be to the simplest and easiest to use bot of its kind, enabling out-of-the-box high-frequency market making to users with limited technical expertise.

Like its hummingbird namesake, the elegant facade is only part of a highly-optimized machine.  Hummingbot was designed for institutional grade performance and reliability. Built on technologies such as Cython (Python compiled into C), Hummingbot utilizes low-level programming to optimize the speed and memory efficiency crucial for executing high frequency trading algorithms.

Hummingbot will serve as a base platform upon which users will be able to customize and build their own market making and trading strategies.

> Hummingbot's design philosophy: fuse simplicity and ease of use with performance and flexibility.
