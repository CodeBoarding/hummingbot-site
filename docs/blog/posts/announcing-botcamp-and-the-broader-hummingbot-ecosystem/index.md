# Announcing Botcamp and the Broader Hummingbot Ecosystem

![cover](cover.png)

We’re excited to formally announce the launch of [Botcamp](https://www.botcamp.xyz), a company that provides education and training programs for market makers and algorithmic traders using the open source Hummingbot software framework. 

Originally, Botcamp started as a side business operated by members of the Hummingbot Foundation team to support the day-to-day operations during the crypto bear market. Five cohorts and more than 200 students later, we established Botcamp Inc. in November 2023 as a new for-profit education company, co-founded by Michael Feng, Hummingbot Foundation board member, and Federico Cardoso, Hummingbot Foundation CTO.

The current Botcamp offerings include:

- **Cohorts**: An online training program that teaches students algo trading and market making fundamentals using the Hummingbot open source software.
- **Courses**: An online training program that teaches students algo trading and market making fundamentals using the Hummingbot open source software.

In the future, we plan to organize hackathons and other events that mobilize the Hummingbot community. We believe that these products and services will help advance the broader Hummingbot mission of making sophisticated trading strategies more accessible to everyone with open source software!

## New Botcamp Cohorts

Botcamp is a professional training program designed specifically for algo traders and market makers. Through structured courses and intensive cohorts, participants learn how to design and develop sophisticated algorithmic trading and market-making strategies from the ground up using Hummingbot.

While we experimented with subscriptions, we believe that the original cohort-based model that we used for five Botcamp cohorts offers more value to students, so all current Botcamp subscribers will have **lifetime access** to their course content.

We are making this change because our experience is that intensive cohorts along with 1:1 mentorship deliver successful outcomes for students. Starting in April, we will resume Botcamp cohorts, 5-week intensive bootcamps that teach students how to design and code a custom algo trading strategy. To improve the student experience, we have launched a new website for Botcamp, which should be its permanent home:

## The Growing Hummingbot Ecosystem

Since the codebase was initially open sourced in 2019, Hummingbot’s goal has always been to build a high-quality, well-maintained open source ecosystem that lets the community contribute modular components like connectors and strategies.

In addition to Hummingbot Foundation and Botcamp, the Hummingbot ecosystem is comprised of a decentralized constellation of entities large and small:

### CoinAlpha

[CoinAlpha](https://coinalpha.com), Hummingbot's original creator, is a software startup and liquidity provider backed by Initialized Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and other leading investors. CoinAlpha operates the Hummingbot Miner liquidity mining platform and provides other liquidity solutions and services using the Hummingbot stack.

### Enflux

[Enflux](https://www.enflux.io/) is restoring trust in crypto market making by providing transparent and collaborative market making services to tokenized projects.

### Funttastic

[Funttastic Labs](https://www.funttastic.com) leads the blockchain innovation wave, mastering High-Frequency Trading (HFT), Market Making (MMing) via Hummingbot, and advancing in Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). 

Our core strengths lie in developing Smart Contracts, leveraging Web3 technologies, and integrating GPT for financial analysis, offering a competitive edge in the cryptocurrency realm. With a profound command over blockchain, our team is adept at crafting strategic solutions that not only embrace the future of finance but also unlock unique investment opportunities.

### Pecunia Finance

[Pecunia.Finance](https://pecuniafinance.com/) is a Web3 Project Management DAO that provides pseudo-anonymous, automated labor infrastructure in a fair and transparent way, which enables organizations and the builders within communities to successfully deliver projects.

Since incorporating as a Non-Profit DAO LLC in 2023, Pecunia.Finance has gained over a dozen skilled contributors worldwide and received 3 separate grants working with organizations such as Hummingbot Foundation, Osmosis, and Sifchain to make high-frequency crypto-trading more accessible to the common user. 

### Robotter

[Robotter.AI](https://robotter.ai) is decentralizing Financial ML & Trading Bot pipelines with the help of Hummingbot, Solana & Aleph.im. We believe in a firmly rooted, transparent, DeFi-centric market. We aim to produce a bleeding-edge, self-sustaining ecosystem for data, compute and capital to fuel a rising class of quantitative traders, AI enthusiasts and web3 developers establishing themselves as the new paragons of liquidity on markets where no institutional player dares to tread.

### QuantAlpha

Created by the founders of CoinAlpha and Hummingbot, [QuantAlpha](https://quantalpha.ai) is a trading and technology firm building “Quant Finance 2.0 for Digital Assets”. QuantAlpha creates investment and trading strategies based on quant methodologies that generate alpha by uncovering trading signals and market patterns, and works with investment managers and hedge funds to create custom investment products and trading solutions, including AMM liquidity staking management and CEX-DEX arbitrage.

QuantAlpha has built its trading execution stack on top of Hummingbot.

### Summit Operations

[Summit Operations](https://summitoperations.co/) offers market making services for CEX and DEX opportunities. Hummingbot is an integral system for our capacity to easily integrate and deploy across markets and platforms. To date we’ve traded over 2.2B in total volume through Hummingbot.


## Toward a Community-Owned Codebase

These firms along with  hundreds of individual contributors form the Hummingbot diverse ecosystem. We work together to help achieve the community-driven codebase that we outlined in the [Technical Roadmap](/blog/hummingbot-2024-technical-roadmap-innovating-for-the-future/).
