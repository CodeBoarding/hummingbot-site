We are excited to launch the 4th Hummingbot governance proposal!

Votes for this current proposal will be based on Hummingbot Miner rewards, giving the ability to vote to community members who have been participating in and supporting currently active Hummingbot liquidity mining campaigns.  

> ## Proposal #4
 > Which of the following community-developed exchange connectors should be included into the core Hummingbot code base in the release v0.37.0?
 >   
 > ‚òê **Altmarkets.io**
 >  
 > ‚òê **IDEX**
 >  
 > ‚òê **Binance Cloud**

Similar to our previous governance votes, the Hummingbot core team will review, test, and incorporate the exchange connector for the winning exchange into our core code base, which will become an officially supported connector. 

## Voting Methodology

- **Votes per miner**: the total votes each miner has is based on the total amount of mining rewards they have earned in the most recent weekly reward period. For example, a miner who earned $100 in the rewards period will have 100 votes.
- **Miner reward period**: for the current proposal, the rewards period used to calculate total miner votes will be the most recently completed period: **January 26, 2021 12:00 AM UTC to February 1, 2021 11:59 PM UTC**
- **Reward amounts will be rounded up to the nearest whole vote**: a miner who earned $0.01 of rewards is still entitled to 1 full vote, while a miner who earned $1.01 will have 2 votes, and so on. This allows for any miner who has earned any amount of rewards to have a minimum of 1 vote.  

## Timetable

- January 26, 2021 12:00 AM UTC to February 1, 2021 11:59 PM UTC: rewards period referenced for determining miner vote amounts
- February 2, 2021: voting is opened
- February 8, 2021 11:59 PM UTC: votes are tallied and outcome determined
- v0.37.0 release time: Early March
