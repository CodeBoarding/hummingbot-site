# Selecting the right markets

![cover](cover.jpg)

<!-- more -->

Choosing the right market is the key to market making success. 

Here are some tips for selecting markets:

1. Select markets that are less volatile
   - Rapid changes in the exchange rate will cause frequent transactions that will make you lose a lot of money through transaction fees
   - The best trading period for market making is the period when the market trend is relatively mild and stable
2. Select markets that have enough liquidity
3. Select markets of which the tokens are in a gradually increasing price
4. Select markets with token pairs that you do not mind long-holding.
5. Currency pair correlation:
   - Some miners prefer trading on markets that are strongly correlated with core token pairs such as BTC or ETH so that they can hedge through these proxy core tokens.
   - We can observe the correlation of currency pairs through Coingecko ([https://www.coingecko.com/](https://www.coingecko.com/?ref=blog.hummingbot.org)) and choose the currency pair with stronger correlation.
   - If the base currency of the pair in the market on the Miner platform is BTC or ETCH, choosing a pair with a strong correlation with BTC or ETH makes the market more predictable.
