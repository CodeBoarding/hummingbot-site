### Missions

**Set up a cloud server for Hummingbot**
- **Mission 3.1:** Set up a cloud server to run Hummingbot with the instructions in the reading list:
- If you face any issues, reach out to #miner-support channel in our Discord group:
- [https://discord.com/invite/hummingbot](https://discord.com/invite/hummingbot?ref=blog.hummingbot.org)

**Set up Telegram integration with Hummingbot**
- **Mission 3.2:** Set up Telegram integration with Hummingbot if you haven’t done so. It allows you to monitor your bot on Telegram and on-the-go and one of the popular features that our traders find helpful
- [Telegram Integration - Hummingbot Foundation](https://hummingbot.org/global-configs/telegram/?ref=blog.hummingbot.org)

**Set up a P&L jupyter notebook / github repo**
- **Mission 3.3:** Build your own processes to manage your P&L. You can take our suggestions as reference here:

**Use token loans to reduce inventory risk**
- **Mission 3.4:** One way to reduce inventory risk is to use token loans. Some exchanges such as [Gate.io](http://gate.io/?ref=blog.hummingbot.org) allow you to loan tokens: [https://www.gate.io/cryptoloan/USDT?ch=ann210](https://www.gate.io/cryptoloan/USDT?ch=ann210&ref=blog.hummingbot.org)
- If your main source of income is through miner rewards from Hummingbot miner, having token loans allow you to not own any of the asset traded and return the same assets to the exchange (eg. Gate.io) without being affected if the assets dropped in value.

**Get breakeven PnL through cross-exchange market making**
- **Mission 3.5:** Cross-exchange market making is one of the relatively ‘easier’ strategies for you to get breakeven PnL as you can reduce inventory risk. Try fine-tuning your cross-exchange market making strategy to get break-even PnL. To be successful in cross-exchange market making, the speed of servers also matter. Feel free to reach out to #trader-chat to learn more about the servers different members are using.
