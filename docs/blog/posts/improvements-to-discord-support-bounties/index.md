# Improvements to the Discord Support Bounties Program

![](cover.webp)

Fourteen months have passed since the introduction of the [Discord Support Program](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ip.eth/proposal/0x588779179d0229db7de2de9e231f3baafb1fcdbde16bcc93bf34b65280e36a1a), an initiative designed to foster active involvement and collaborative problem-solving within the Hummingbot Discord community channels. This program has enabled the Foundation team to engage community developers and users in mutual support, freeing up our resources to focus on areas such as enhancing documentation, creating user guides, and improving the Hummingbot codebase.

But with the introduction of new Hummingbot features like [Dashboard](https://github.com/hummingbot/dashboard) and [V2 Strategies](https://hummingbot.org/v2-strategies), newer members of our community have struggling to keep pace with troubleshooting and issue resolution. In response, the Foundation team has intensified its engagement with community members on Discord by answering questions. Moreover, we are committed to keeping our community members abreast of the newest Hummingbot developments on the [roadmap](/blog/hummingbot-2024-technical-roadmap-innovating-for-the-future/), including the imminent launch of the Condor Telegram bot, custom screeners, and advanced AI capabilities.

## Key Changes

In order to increase community participation in answering questions and making the program fairer and more transparent, we're excited to announce some changes to the Discord Support Program:

<!-- more -->

### Increased Weekly Payouts

In the recently approved [HGP-50](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth/proposal/0xc13f3b9fdaded22d1ce0b5528c9146fb2a762c41deed88e6c64e798465414738) governance proposal, HBOT holders approved the continuation of the Discord Support Program for 2024, allocating a **100,000 HBOT budget per week** to be used to reward users who provide quality answers to questions other users ask on Discord.

### Adjusted Reward Percentage

We have changed the maximum reward percentage that a single user can earn will be reduced from **20%** to **10%** of the weekly payout. This adjustment will enable a broader distribution of rewards among community members.

### Revised Point System

These changes are designed to incentive community members who offer practical and effective solutions, especially related to recently released features:

  - 1 point for a basic answer
  - 2 points for answers concerning V2 Strategies, Dashboard, and other new/advanced Hummingbot features
  - 3 points for going the extra mile in assisting users and hand-holding them through their issues

    How are points allocated each week?

### Discord `support-evaluator` Role

Previously, only Foundation staff members could grant points for answers, with the caveat that they could not grant points for their own answers. Going forward, we will formalize this process so that only users with the `support-evaluator` role can grant points, which will enable both designated community members and Foundation team members to award points for quality answers.

The initial appointees include active members of the Discord Support Program, such as `wojak`, `hbminerfan`, and `Memento Mori`. As the number of community support providers grow, we plan to expand this list of support evaluators in lockstep.

### Discord Support Leaderboard 

We plan to add a `Discord Support Leaderboard` sheet to the [HBOT Tracker Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNAumPMnXfsghAAXrfKkPGRH9QlC8k7Cu1FGQVL1t0M/edit?usp=sharing), which will track the support rewards that users have earned and rank the top earners.

This will not only motivate new members to join but also recognize and appreciate the contributions of our helpful community members.

We believe these updates will greatly contribute to achieving a more transparent, decentralized, and fair system for distributing incentives among our Discord community members. If community members have feedback and suggestions to further improve this system, please let us know!
