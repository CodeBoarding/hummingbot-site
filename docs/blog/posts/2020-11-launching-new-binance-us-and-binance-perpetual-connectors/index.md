We are excited to launch Hummingbot‚Äôs new [Binance.us](https://www.binance.us/en/home) connector and Binance Futures connector (beta) in our next release v0.33.0, which will be shipped on November 9th! 

Binance is a global cryptocurrency exchange that provides a platform for trading more than 100 cryptocurrencies. Since the launch of Hummingbot, we have been working closely with Binance to provide Hummingbot‚Äôs automated trading capability to Binance users and grow participation in liquidity mining on Binance. 

The Binance.us connector is one of the most highly requested connectors within the Hummingbot community. Many of the Hummingbot users residing in the United States have been waiting for this connector so that they can deploy Hummingbot‚Äôs automated trading capabilities on Binance. 

In addition to the Binance.us connector, the v0.33.0 release will also contain a Binance.com USDT-M Futures connector that allows users to trade [perpetual contracts](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts) using Hummingbot.  Trading in crypto derivatives has been a rapidly growing market which has been the main focus of most major derivatives exchanges over the past year.  Consequently, support for derivatives has been one of the most anticipated and asked for capabilities from the Hummingbot community.  Adding support for Binance perpetual futures is the first of our future initiatives and forays into this space.

A perpetual contract is a special derivative product, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price in the future. However, unlike the traditional futures, it doesn‚Äôt have an expiry date, which means traders can keep the position open for as long as they like. Another difference between the traditional futures and the perpetual contracts is that the latter is priced based on an underlying Index Price of the spot market. Therefore, the perpetual contracts are often traded at a price that is equal or close to the spot price. This new connector is an initial beta version and our first connector that enables for derivatives.  **We encourage our community to test it out and provide us with [feedback](mailto:team@hummingbot.io)**. 

### What‚Äôs next

With the Binance.us connector, we are also working with the Binance.us team on exploring bringing Hummingbot Miner liquidity mining to the exchange. 

Simultaneously, we are working hard to collect user feedback and improve the new Binance USDT-M Futures connector, giving another powerful tool in the investment toolkit for our users. We are looking forward to continuing to expand Hummingbot‚Äôs derivatives capabilities to other derivatives products and exchanges in the future.
