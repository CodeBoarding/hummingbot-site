### 10-month Summary Statistics
For a discussion and explanation of some of the metrics we are tracking, please see our blog post - [Liquidity mining: April recap](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-05-liquidity-mining-2nd-month-recap/).

To date, we have seen 1,179 unique miners participate in providing liquidity on Hummingbot Miner. From March 2020 to December 2020, order book depth created by liquidity miners resulted in $303.6 million of traded volume. Meanwhile, the rewards paid out to miners has totaled USD 215,362 equivalent, resulting in cost-effective market making for token issuers.

Since the platform’s launch, we have run campaigns on Binance.com for 15 different token issuers for 46 different trading pairs. In December, we launched three new campaigns, for [Ava Lab’s Avalanche](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-12-ava-labs-avalanche-hummingbot-liquidity-mining/) (AVAX) tokens, [Phoenix Global](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-12-phoenix-global-hummingbot-liquidity-mining/) (PHB), and [Frontier](https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-12-frontier-hummingbot-liquidity-mining-campaign/) (FRONT).  We have proven that our system and concept of liquidity mining is able to serve token issuers’ needs efficiently and effectively.

As we kick off 2021, we hope to carry the momentum of strong activity in December to the new year! We are already working on announcing new campaigns shortly as well as looking to expand liquidity mining capabilities to additional exchanges.  After launching the platform, our focus in 2020 had mainly been on system stability and scalability.  This allowed us to lay the groundwork for efficient expansion to additional exchanges, which is our key initiative for 2021. So stay tuned!

### Filled Order Volume VS. Reward pool

While liquidity mining does not compensate miners for filled order volume, the increased liquidity and order book depth created by miners does translate into increased trading efficiently and, consequently, additional trading volume. Trading volume is important for issuers since exchanges typically use traded volume as a benchmark more deciding whether or not to maintain or remove token listings

![](./rewards-vs-filled-order-volume.png)

- A total reward pool of equivalent USD 215,362 yielded $303.6 million of traded volume across campaigns¹

- On average, a weekly reward pool of equivalent USD 1,250 (our minimum recommended amount for issuers for a campaign), resulted in monthly average of $2.8M filled order volume¹

***Note 1) Liquidity mining does not reward for filled order volume nor does it guarantee a certain amount of filled order volume. The above figures are based on historical data from currently running and historical liquidity mining campaigns.***

**There was a range across campaigns, which can be seen in the following charts:**
