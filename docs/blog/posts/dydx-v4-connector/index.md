## Hummingbot Foundation x dYdX: A Collaborative Milestone

This release marks a significant milestone in the collaboration between the [Hummingbot Foundation](/about/) and the dYdX ecosystem. Earlier this year, the Hummingbot Foundation was awarded a grant from the [dYdX Grants Program](https://dydxgrants.com/) to support the development of the dYdX V4 connector. This grant has enabled us to dedicate focused resources to ensure that our users can fully leverage the latest advancements in the dYdX protocol.

The grant underscores dYdX's commitment to empowering its ecosystem through robust developer tools and community-driven innovation. We are proud to contribute to this initiative by providing a powerful and reliable connector that enhances the trading capabilities of our community.

## Key Benefits of the dYdX V4 Connector

- **Access to a Leading Perp DEX**: This connector opens the door for thousands of market makers and algo traders who build on top of the Hummingbot framework to access and trade on dYdX, a leading decentralized perpetual contract exchange. This access empowers traders to tap into dYdX's deep liquidity and innovative trading features.
- **Supported by the Latest Hummingbot V2 Framework**: The connector is fully integrated with the latest [Hummingbot V2 framework](/v2-strategies/), which includes powerful tools for backtesting and multi-bot deployment. This means traders can now optimize and deploy multiple trading strategies simultaneously, all while utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Hummingbot V2 infrastructure.
- **Community-Driven Strategy Sharing**: The Hummingbot community now has the opportunity to develop and share dYdX-specific trading strategies and dashboard pages. This collaboration fosters innovation and helps traders leverage collective knowledge, making it easier to succeed on the dYdX platform.
