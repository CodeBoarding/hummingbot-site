As mentioned in the [HBOT announcement](/blog/2021/10/25/introducing-the-hummingbot-foundation/), The Hummingbot Foundation is distributing HBOT tokens to directly to the wallets of eligible historical code contributors who register on the Claim Site ([https://claim.hummingbot.org](https://claim.hummingbot.org)).

In the first weekly distribution, 20.84 million HBOT tokens (52% of the Retroactive Distribution), were sent to 351 recipients. Recipients should see an email titled ‚ÄúYour HBOT tokens are here!‚Äù from Hummingbot Foundation <claim@hummingbot.org> with information about the distribution.

The distribution period lasts until February 28, 2022, so please claim your HBOT tokens on the Claim Site before then.
