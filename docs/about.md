The Hummingbot Foundation is a not-for-profit organization established in the Cayman Islands. The Foundation’s mission is to democratize high-frequency trading by enabling decentralized maintenance and community governance over the open-source Hummingbot code repository.

## Principles

Below are the core principles that underpin Hummingbot’s development:

* **Open Source**: The Hummingbot codebase is publicly available, auditable, and free
* **Modular**: Hummingbot modules can be independently built, used, and maintained by community members
* **Extensible**: Users can use Hummingbot to create any automated trading strategy on every exchange and blockchain
* **All Levels**: Hummingbot is designed for use by individuals and professionals alike

## Purpose

The foundation’s primary role is to coordinate the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the open source Hummingbot codebase via a decentralized set of actors: Sponsors, Contributors, Maintainers, and Users.

The medium of governance is the Hummingbot Governance Token (HBOT), a standard ERC-20 token with a fixed total supply. The sole use case for HBOT is to empower holders to decide how the Hummingbot codebase changes over time through proposals. 

See [Governance](/governance) for more details.

## Board of Directors

The Board of Directors provides oversight over the foundation and its staff, and it also manages the HBOT treasury in a multi-signature wallet. All wallet transactions must be signed by a majority of the board.

## History

Hummingbot is the leading open source software for building market making and arbitrage bots. Launched in April 2019, Hummingbot served the cryptocurrency market’s need for liquidity by enabling anyone to become a liquidity provider. Because Hummingbot pioneered a modular architecture that allowed external developers to contribute new exchange connectors and trading strategies, it has scaled into a bazaar-style open source project with many contributors and users around the world, both individual and professional.

Hummingbot was originally built and opensourced by CoinAlpha, Inc, a startup based in Mountain View, California. CoinAlpha is backed by [Initialized Capital](https://initialized.com/), [Bain Capital Ventures](https://www.baincapitalventures.com/), [Defiance Capital](https://www.defiance.capital/), and other leading crypto and fintech investors.

CoinAlpha runs businesses that support the Hummingbot ecosystem, such as:

* [Hummingbot Miner](https://miner.hummingbot.io): a decentralized market making platform where Hummingbot users can run market making bots on centralized exchanges to earn token rewards from token issuers who seek a decentralized, community-based alternative to hiring market makers for liquidity services
* [Hummingbot Pro](/developers/architecture/#hummingbot-pro-preview): a forthcoming module that combines a Cython-based backtesting engine plugin, access to historical order book data, and associated services/support aimed at professional and institutional Hummingbot users.

In October 2021, CoinAlpha [announced](/news/foundation) plans to launch the Hummingbot Foundation, a new open source foundation that maintains the Hummingbot Github repository and administers a decentralized, community-driven system of software development. 

The Hummingbot Foundation was established in December 2021.
