Hummingbot is an open source Python-based framework that helps you run trading strategies that automate the execution of orders and trades on various cryptocurrency exchanges and protocols. 

## Repos

The Hummingbot framework features multiple code repositories and modular components that allow the codebase to be maintained and extended by individual community members. It is hosted on the [Hummingbot Foundation Github](https://github.com/hummingbot).

The main Hummingbot code repositories are:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- [__Hummingbot__](/client) Core command line client and exchange connectors
- [__Deploy__](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy) Docker deployment repo
- [__Dashboard__](/dashboard) Hummingbot 2.0 front-end user interface
- [__Backend API__](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy): Hummingbot 2.0 back-end API
- [__Gateway__](/gateway) API middleware for DEX connectors
- [__Site__](https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy): This site - contributions welcome!

## Installation

We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if you want the simplest, easiest installation method and don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase. Check out [Install via Docker](/installation/docker) for the basic process.

!!! note
    If you're a developer looking to customize the software, consider installing Hummingbot from source. Here are detailed instructions for each operating system: [Linux](/installation/linux) | [Windows](/installation/windows) | [MacOS](/installation/mac)

## [Strategies](/strategies)

A Hummingbot strategy loads market data directly from centralized and decentralized exchanges, adaptable to the unique features of each trading venue's WebSocket/REST APIs and nodes, and executes logic defined by the strategy creator.

There are 2 current ways that Hummingbot strategies can be defined:

[Scripts](/scripts): Scripts are the entry point for all Hummingbot strategies. A script's `on_tick` method defines the actions taken each clock tick, and it provides access to core Hummingbot components like connectors.

They can range in complexity from a simple Python file that contains all strategy logic to a launcher script launches multiple Controllers, each defining a separate sub-strategy. 

[Controllers](/v2-strategies/controllers): Controllers define a modularized strategy based on the Strategy V2 [architecture](/v2-strategies/), which makes them backtestable, allows them to access market data more efficiently, and lets them be deployable using Dashboard.

In the past, there were [V1 Strategies](/v1-strategies/), which are legacy strategy templates that are less customizable. These were the original Hummingbot strategies and they are more rigid than those built using the StrategyV2 framework.

## [Connectors](/exchanges/)

Hummingbot connectors standardize trading logic and order types across different types of exchanges and blockchain networks, so that strategies can access standardized methods that work across all connectors of that type.

Each connector's code is contained in modularized folders in the Hummingbot and/or Gateway codebases:

- [CEXs](/cex-connectors): Connectors to centralized exchanges (CEX)

- [DEX](/dex-connectors): Connectors to decentralized exchanges (DEX)

- [Chains](/chains): Connectors to Layer 1 blockchain networks
