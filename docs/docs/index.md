Hummingbot is a local software client that helps you run trading strategies that automate the execution of orders and trades on various cryptocurrency exchanges and protocols. The Hummingbot architecture features modular components that can be maintained and extended by individual community members.

## Installation

We recommend installing Hummingbot using Docker if you want the simplest, easiest installation method and don't need to modify the Hummingbot codebase. Check out [Install via Docker](/installation/docker) for the basic process.

If you're a developer looking to customize the software, consider installing Hummingbot from source. Here are detailed instructions for each operating system:

* [Linux](../installation/linux.md)
* [Windows](../installation/windows.md)
* [MacOS](../installation/mac.md)

## [Connectors](/exchanges/)

Hummingbot connectors standardize trading logic and order types across different types of exchanges and blockchain networks, so that strategies can access standardized methods that work across all connectors of that type.

Each connector's code is contained in modularized folders in the Hummingbot and/or Gateway codebases:

- [CEXs](/cex-connectors): Connectors to centralized exchanges (CEX)

- [DEX](/dex-connectors): Connectors to decentralized exchanges (DEX)

- [Chains](/chains): Connectors to Layer 1 blockchain networks
