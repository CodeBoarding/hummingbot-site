# `osmosis`

`osmosis` is a [Chain](/chains) connector in Hummingbot Gateway that helps users connect to Osmoisis DEX on the Osmosis Blockchain.

## 📁 Connector Info

- Folder: [/gateway/src/chains/osmosis](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/tree/main/src/chains/osmosis)
- Configs: [/gateway/src/templates/osmosis.yml](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway/tree/main/src/templates/osmosis.yml)

!!! note "Osmosis utilizes Cosmos chain elements"
The Osmosis chain was built using the Cosmos SDK as a base, though has evolved so far as to require a native chain connector instead of using the [Cosmos Chain](/chains/cosmos). Some Cosmos elements are still used.
