# Running a V2 Script

In this section we'll configure and then run one of the v2 scripts - `v2_market-making_dman_v3_multiple_pairs.py`

## Open the Script for Editing

Before we run the strategy we'll need to make some changes to the parameters first. We'll use the `nano` command line editor to make the changes to the script first. Run the following commands in the terminal

#### Using Nano Editor

- Open the script in the nano editor with this command:

```bash
nano hummingbot_files/scripts/v2_market-making_dman_v3_multiple_pairs.py
```

#### Using your Preferred Editor

- If you're not comfortable with nano, feel free to use any text editor you're familiar with.

- After editing, ensure to copy the modified script back into the `hummingbot_files/scripts` folder.

Access the script here - [v2_market-making_dman_v3_multiple_pairs.py](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot/blob/master/scripts/v2_market-making_dman_v3_multiple_pairs.py)
