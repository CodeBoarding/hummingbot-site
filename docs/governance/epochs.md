The Hummingbot Foundation is an experiment in creating a self-sustainable open source ecosystem. We plan to iterate and improve on this distribution process via **Epochs**.

Each Epoch is a fixed period that are basically long agile sprints, after which the Foundation will conduct an open retrospective and strengthen internal processes for the next Epoch.

## Epoch 1

- **Start**: Feb 1, 2022
- **End**: June 30, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 30 million HBOT tokens

The last day to submit [Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIPs)](/governance/proposals/#hip) requesting a share of Dev Grant Budgets is May 31, 2022, and the last day to submit [Pull Request Proposals (PRPs)](/governance/proposals/#prp) linked to approved HIPs is June 30, 2022.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Liquidity Distributions | 15,000,000                | 10 platforms             |
| Dev Grant Budget              | 10,000,000                | 50 dev grants           |
| Initiative Budget     | 5,000,000                 | 5 initiatives           |

After Epoch 1, the Foundation conducted a [retrospective](https://forum.hummingbot.org/t/epoch-2-proposed-governance-changes-part-1/45/1) and enacted a number of [changes](https://forum.hummingbot.org/t/epoch-2-proposed-changes-master-thread/129) to the governance process. Specifically, the Foundation decided to start the following initiatives:

* Start the [Exchange Certification](/governance/certification/) initiative
* Create more structure around the [Bounties](/governance/bounties/) process
* Start a developer bootcamp [Botcamp](https://hummingbot.org/botcamp/)

## Epoch 2

- **Start**: August 1, 2022
- **End**: December 31, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 30 million HBOT tokens

| Category          | HBOT Allocation |
| ------------------|-----------------|
| Dev Grant Budget  | 15,000,000      |
| Liquidity Distributions | 5,000,000 |
| Community Work    | 10,000,000      |

After Epoch 2, the Foundation conducted a [retrospective] and decided to enact the following changes:

* Change epoch cadence to from bi-annually to quarterly
* Start [Polls](/governance/polls/) to make HBOT governance easier
* Cease defining per-epoch HBOT distribution targets

## Epoch 3

- **Start**: January 1, 2023
- **End**: March 31, 2023

Starting with Epoch 3, epochs are fixed periods that define how the Foundation allocates bandwidth to the exchanges, strategies, and other components via quarterly [Polls](/governance/polls/).

*Pending poll completion in January 2023*
