The Hummingbot Foundation is an experiment in creating a self-sustainable open source ecosystem. [Distribution](/hbot/#community-distributions) of the remaining HBOT community reserves (36 million tokens or 36% of total HBOT supply) to the Hummingbot user base over the next 4 years is an important aspect of preserving Foundation self-sustainability. Therefore, the Foundation plans to iterate and improve on this distribution process via **Epochs**. 

Each Epoch is a fixed, 5-month period with specific HBOT distribution-related goals across various categories. Epochs are basically long agile sprints, after which the Foundation will conduct an open retrospective and strengthen internal processes for the next Epoch.

## Epoch 1

- **Start**: Feb 1, 2022
- **HIP cutoff**: May 31, 2022
- **End, PRP cutoff**: June 30, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 30 million HBOT tokens

The last day to submit [Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIPs)](/governance/proposals/hip/) requesting a share of Dev Grant Budgets is May 31, 2022, and the last day to submit [Pull Request Proposals (PRPs)](/governance/proposals/prp/) linked to approved HIPs is June 30, 2022.

| Category                                                                      | Total HBOT Available      | Target Number of Grants |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Liquidity Distributions | 15,000,000                | 10 platforms             |
| Dev Grant Budget              | 10,000,000                | 50 dev grants           |
| Initiative Budget     | 5,000,000                 | 5 initiatives           |

### Retrospective

After Epoch 1, the Foundation conducted a retrospective and recommended a number of improvements to the governance process to make it more community-oriented and efficient:

* [Epoch 2 proposed governance changes (Part 1)](https://hummingbot.discourse.group/t/epoch-2-proposed-governance-changes-part-1/45/1)
* [Epoch 2 proposed governance changes (Part 2)](https://hummingbot.discourse.group/t/epoch-2-proposed-governance-changes-part-2/123)
* [Epoch 2 proposed changes (master thread)](https://hummingbot.discourse.group/t/epoch-2-proposed-changes-master-thread/129)

After discussing these changes with the community in weekly calls, the Foundation proceeded to implement these changes starting in Epoch 2.

## Epoch 2

- **Start**: August 1, 2022
- **End**: December 31, 2022
- **Goal**: Distribute 30 million HBOT tokens

| Category          | HBOT Allocation |
| ------------------|-----------------|
| Dev Grant Budget  | 15,000,000      |
| Liquidity Distributions | 5,000,000 |
| Community Work    | 10,000,000      |

Similar to Epoch 1, we plan to conduct an open retrospective and strengthen Foundation processes after Epoch 2.
