We separate the HBOT distribution process into epochs. These are basically long sprints, after which we will conduct an open retrospective and try to improve the process in the next epoch.

## Epoch 1

- Goal: distribute 30m HBOT tokens
- Dates: Feb 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022

### Distribution Targets

- Liquidity Distributions: 15 million tokens
- Dev Grants: 10 million tokens
- Community Initiatives: 5 million tokens

### Guidance for requesting HBOT rewards

Devs submitting Improvement Proposals should include the following fields in each IP

- Estimated number of dev days
- Number of HBOT tokens requested
- Implied USD daily rate based on current HBOT prices

#### Example: bug fix

- 2 days
- 10k HBOT
- $200/day at @$0.04 HBOT price

#### Example: new connector

- 15 days
- 100k HBOT
- $266/day at $0.04 HBOT price

Projects that require more than one month of work should first be submitted as GPs, then broken up into individual smaller tasks submitted as IPs

## Epoch 2

- Goal: distribute 60m HBOT tokens
- July 1, 2022 to Dec 31, 2022
