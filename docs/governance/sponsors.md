# A Guide to Sponsoring a Bounty with Hummingbot

**Hummingbot**, an open-source project that enables the creation of algorithmic trading bots for cryptocurrencies, offers a unique opportunity for contributors and sponsors alike. The project's bounty system incentivizes developers to contribute to the project, while sponsors can directly influence the development direction by funding specific issues or enhancements. If you are interested in sponsoring a bounty, here's how you can get started.

## Step 1: Initiate a Discussion on Discord

The first step to sponsor a bounty involves creating a thread on Discord. Hummingbot maintains an active community on Discord, where you can find a specific channel dedicated to community bounties (#community-bounties).

To start, visit the Hummingbot Discord server using this link: <https://discord.gg/hummingbot>. Once there, navigate to the `#community-bounties` channel and create a new thread discussing the specific issue or enhancement you wish to sponsor.

Ensure your thread outlines the problem or improvement in detail, highlighting the reasons you believe it's important, and how the Hummingbot community could benefit from addressing it.

## Step 2: Fund the Hummingbot Bounty Wallet

In order to fund the bounty, the Sponsor will need to send the bounty amount, which could be in $HBOT or other ERC-20 Ethereum tokens, to a designated Foundation Ethereum wallet. The process of sending tokens to this wallet is similar to conducting any other transaction on the Ethereum network.

Once the Foundation has received the bounty in their Ethereum wallet, they will review the bounty for approval. It's crucial to ensure that the bounty amount is attractive enough to encourage participation from talented developers.

Remember, by sponsoring a bounty, you're making a significant contribution to the Hummingbot project, enabling important improvements and new features that will benefit the entire community.

## Step 3: Get Approval

Instead of a community voting process, the approval of your proposed bounty will come directly from the `Hummingbot Foundation` staff. This ensures that the tasks being proposed align with the project's overall direction and goals.

After you've created the Discord thread, Foundation will collaborate with you to fully scope the bounty. This process will involve creating a detailed Github issue, which will serve as the official record and roadmap for the bounty. The issue should provide a clear description of the work required, the acceptance criteria, and an appropriate schedule or bounty amount given the scope of work.

This collaboration between the sponsor and the Foundation ensures that the task is well-defined and that the bounty amount is fair and attractive to potential developers. It also enables the Foundation to manage and oversee the bounty effectively, ensuring that it aligns with the project's objectives and timelines.

Remember, the more detailed and precise the Github issue, the better. A well-scoped bounty will attract talented developers and lead to more effective and timely solutions.

## Step 4: Let Hummingbot Foundation Handle the Rest

Once the bounty is approved, the Hummingbot Foundation takes over. They will handle the task of posting the bounty, managing submissions, and disbursing the bounty to the developer who successfully completes the task.

Throughout this process, you can stay involved by monitoring progress, participating in discussions, and providing feedback. However, the administrative and management aspects will be handled by the Hummingbot Foundation, allowing you to focus on the bigger picture.

Remember, by sponsoring a bounty, you are not just contributing to the project, but also influencing its development direction. This is an excellent way to ensure that Hummingbot continues to evolve in a manner that benefits its user community, aligns with market needs, and stays at the forefront of algorithmic trading technology.
