## Bounty

Bounties are generally rewards given out by the Foundation or any community member to fix a bug or add an improvement to Hummingbot for the community's benefit as well.

See the plans for [Epoch 2](/governance/epochs/epoch2/)

### How to identify the issues with Bounties?

Go to the [Hummingbot Foundation Github](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) under `Issues` and click on `labels` then choose between `hbot_bounty` or `community_bounty`. Any issues with those labels would be filtered and listed.

### Bounties board

The Foundation created a [Github board](https://github.com/orgs/hummingbot/projects/7/views/1) in which you can see the status of all the bugs that have bounties and also improvements that are currently active.

`Bugs`

Issues with `hbot_bounty` or `community_bounty` are listed in that column

`Improvements`

Community members would need to create an HIP that must pass the voting process and attach a community bounty in order to be added under the `improvements` column.

`In progress`

This means that an issue or improvement has already been taken by a community dev.

`Submitted`

A PR has been submitted by a community developer. Always practice to attach the corresponding issue.

`Merged`

In this column you can see that the PR created has been merged in the current `development` branch.

`Paid`

This is the last step of the process as PRs that are placed in this column means that the community developer has been already paid.
