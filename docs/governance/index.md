The purpose of the Hummingbot Foundation is to empower the HBOT token holders to govern many aspects of Hummingbot, such as:

* Approving all pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Proposing improvements and architectural changes to the Hummingbot codebase
* Modifying parameters of the HBOT governance system
* Electing the foundation's Board of Directors
* Allocating grants and other expenditures of the community treasury

For more information, see the [Hummingbot Foundation Governance whitepaper](/whitepaper).

## Proposals

HBOT holders can vote on three types of proposals:

* **Pull Request Proposal (PRP)**: a proposal linked to an open pull request in the Hummingbot code repository
* **Improvement Proposal (IP)**: a proposal linked to an issue in the Hummingbot Github repository that specifies a proposed improvement to a component of the Hummingbot codebase
* **Governance Proposal (GP)**: a proposal linked to an issue in the Hummingbot Github repository that specifies either a proposed modification to the Foundation governance system, or a proposed distribution of HBOT tokens from the treasury for a community activity such as a grant. 

Each proposal type has different governance parameters:

| Proposal Type           | Pull Request            | Improvement             | Governance              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |

| Quorum Percentage       | 1% of HBOT total supply | 3% of HBOT total supply | 10% of HBOT total supply |
| Approval Threshold      | >50% of tokens voted    | >50% of tokens voted    | >50% of tokens voted    |
| Vote Duration           | 7 days                  | 14 days                 | 14 days                 |
