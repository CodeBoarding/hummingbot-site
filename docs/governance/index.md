The purpose of the Hummingbot Foundation is to empower the HBOT token holders to govern many aspects of Hummingbot, such as:

* Approving pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Proposing improvements and architectural changes to the Hummingbot codebase
* Modifying parameters of the HBOT governance system
* Electing the foundation's Board of Directors
* Allocating grants and other expenditures of the community treasury

### Snapshot

All **proposal voting** occur on the offical Hummingbot [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth), which features an off-chain, gas-less voting system that allows you to vote by signing messages using your HBOT token balance as of a certain block.

Each proposal type has its Snapshot sub-space:

* Pull Request Proposals (PRP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-prp.eth>
* Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ip.eth>
* Hummingbot Governance Proposals (HGP): <https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth>

* [Epochs](epochs.md): Quarterly periods with fixed exchange and strategy tiers that are defined via polls
