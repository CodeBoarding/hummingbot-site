The purpose of the Hummingbot Foundation is to empower the HBOT token holders to govern many aspects of Hummingbot, such as:

* Approving all pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Proposing improvements and architectural changes to the Hummingbot codebase
* Modifying parameters of the HBOT governance system
* Electing the foundation's Board of Directors
* Allocating grants and other expenditures of the community treasury

For more information, see the [Hummingbot Foundation Governance whitepaper](whitepaper).

## Proposals

HBOT token holders can create and vote on various types of **Proposals** to steer the evolution of the project. Each proposal type may have different guidelines, HBOT balance requirements, and approval/quorum thresholds.

See [Proposals](proposals) for more information.

## Epochs

In order to continually iterate and improve the governance process, we divide the next Hummingbot's future into **Epochs**. 

Epochs are a series of 5-month periods that allocate target HBOT distribution budgets across various HGP categories. Basically, epochs are long "sprints" that enable the Foundation to conduct a retrospective afterwards and improve the process for the next epoch.

See [Epochs](epochs) for more information.

## How to Participate

We use a number of platforms that enable community engagement in different ways. Below, we offer guidance to help the community decide how to participate in governance.

### Discord

[Discord](http://discord.hummingbot.io) is our **community hub**. Start here to meet the community and learn about how to participate in the Hummingbot ecosystem:

* General chat
* Developer chat
* Foundation announcements
* Hummingbot technical support
* Monthly community calls

### Hummingbot Forum

Use the official [Humminggbot Forum](https://hummingbot.discourse.group) for **long-form discussions** and to get feedback on exploratory ideas, proposals, and team projects. The threads you create are persistent and categorized, so that don't get lost in Discord.

* Starting point for new proposals
* Community feedback
* Exploratory research

### Snapshot

All **proposal voting** occur on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/), which features an off-chain, gas-less voting system that allows you to vote by signing messages using your HBOT token balance as of a certain block.

Each Proposal type has a different Snapshot space dedicated to it:

* Pull Request Proposals (PRP): https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-prp.eth
* Hummingbot Improvement Proposals (HIP): https://snapshot.org/#/hbot-ip.eth
* Hummingbot Governance Proposals (HGP): https://snapshot.org/#/hbot.eth

### Github

For feedback or questions relating to the Hummingbot codebase, please create an issue in [Github](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) an reference specific sections of the code where applicable.

* Feedback on Pull Request Proposals
* Feature requests for new exchange connectors and strategies
* Code comments and questions
