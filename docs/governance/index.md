The purpose of the Hummingbot Foundation is to empower the HBOT token holders to govern many aspects of Hummingbot, such as:

* Approving all pull requests to the Hummingbot codebase
* Proposing improvements and architectural changes to the Hummingbot codebase
* Modifying parameters of the HBOT governance system
* Electing the foundation's Board of Directors
* Allocating grants and other expenditures of the community treasury

For more information, see the [Hummingbot Foundation Governance whitepaper](/whitepaper).

## Proposals

HBOT holders can vote on three types of proposals:

* [**Pull Request Proposal (PRP)**](/governance/prp): a proposal linked to an open pull request in the Hummingbot code repository. The community votes if the linked Pull Request should be added to the main code-base; 
* **Improvement Proposal (IP)**: a proposal of an improvement to a component of the Hummingbot codebase.
* **Governance Proposal (GP)**: a proposal for modification to the Foundation governance system, or a proposed distribution of HBOT tokens from the treasury for a community activity such as a grant.

Each proposal type has different governance parameters:

| Proposal Type                | Pull Request              | Improvement             | Governance               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------  - | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |

| Quorum Percentage            | 0.1% of HBOT total supply | 3% of HBOT total supply | 10% of HBOT total supply |
| Approval Threshold           | >50% of tokens approved   | >50% of tokens approved | >50% of tokens approved  |
| Vote Duration                | 7 days                    | 14 days                 | 14 days                  |
