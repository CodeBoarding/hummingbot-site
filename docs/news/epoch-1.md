As mentioned in the [HBOT announcement](/news/hbot), 36 million tokens (36% of total HBOT supply) will be distributed to the Hummingbot user base over the next 4 years following inception of the Hummingbot Foundation. See [Community Distributions](hbot/#community-distributions) for the full schedule.

This article explains how the Foundation plans to distribute the HBOT tokens during the first [Epoch](/governance/epochs), a period lasting from February 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 with specific HBOT distribution targets across various categories of work that incentivize community usage and development of the Hummingbot software. After each Epoch, the Foundation will conduct an open retrospective and try to iterate/improve in the next one.

Before going into the Epoch 1 plan, we first explain what the HBOT token represents and how the HBOT distribution plan benefits the Hummingbot ecosystem.

## Open source client software

Hummingbot is not a protocol, but rather **open source client software** that helps users create trading bots that execute market making and arbitrage [strategies](/strategies) on centralized and decentralized [exchanges](/exchanges). Unlike a protocol, Hummingbot is a modular local software client that encourages community developers to fork and extend its code. With 1200+ forks and 112 contributors to its Github repository, Hummingbot is one of the most decentralized developer ecosystems in crypto. 

We believe that a decentralized, community-led approach should be applied to building client software as well as protocols. 
Client software like trading bots play an important, symbiotic role in providing liquidity and improving market efficiency to exchanges and protocols. Trading bots need access to wallet private keys and exchange API keys in order to automatically respond to market conditions, why is why Hummingbot is an open source, publicly auditable codebase.

As Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike wrote in a recent [blog post](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) about web3:

> “One thing that has always felt strange to me about the cryptocurrency world is the lack of attention to the client/server interface. When people talk about blockchains, they talk about distributed trust, leaderless consensus, and all the mechanics of how that works, but often gloss over the reality that clients ultimately can’t participate in those mechanics. All the network diagrams are of servers, the trust model is between servers, everything is about servers.”

As the industry-leading trading bot framework that standardizes connectivity to both centralized and decentralized exchanges, Hummingbot has become an indispensable tool for many individual traders and market makers, as well and professional developers at many token issuers, exchanges, and trading firms. **Hummingbot is a public good that should be governed by its community.**

## Self-sustainable public good

Hummingbot is one of the only internally-funded and self-sustainable public goods projects in crypto. As Vitalik Buterin lamented in a recent [blog post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html):

> Any single centralized organization will inevitably have blindspots and at least a few categories and teams whose value that it fails to understand; this is not because anyone involved is doing anything wrong, but because such perfection is beyond the reach of small groups of humans. *So there is great value in creating a more diversified and resilient approach to public goods funding to take the pressure off any single organization.*

From [14+ agreements](/maintenance/agreements) with exchanges that rebate fees based on user trading activity along their respective connectors, **the Foundation is cashflow positive from inception**. As the number of exchange connectors and users increase, we expect this cashflow margin to increase significantly greater than maintenance costs, and excess proceeds will be held in the Foundation treasury available for HBOT token holders to decide how to allocate.

To give the community transparency into operations, the Foundation will publish the monthly fees shared and the estimated fee-generating volume collected from each exchange partner, along with the share paid to staffing costs, maintainers, and allocation to the community. The Foundation plans to publish a [Monthly Report](/maintenance/reports/) listing these sources and uses of funds, starting in February 2022.

## HBOT give DAO-like ownership to users

Since fees shared from exchange partnerships fund day-to-day operations, the HBOT token can be reserved exclusively for governance. Similar to participants in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), HBOT token holders control many aspects of the Hummingbot Foundation, including the ability to approve all pull requests to the codebase, electing Board of Directors, and allocating how HBOT is distributed. 100% of the HBOT token supply will be distributed to past and future users of the Hummingbot software, and the Foundation will never sell or issue more HBOT tokens.

For the remaining 36 million tokens to be distributed, the Foundation believes that these tokens should be distributed in order to:

* Distribute HBOT tokens to users of the Hummingbot software
* Partner with exchanges to enable community developers to build/maintain connector and incentivize users to provide liquidity using the connector
* Grow the number of users by making Hummingbot easier to use, more flexible, and more powerful
* Diversify the number of maintainers that maintain individual components in the Hummingbot codebase
