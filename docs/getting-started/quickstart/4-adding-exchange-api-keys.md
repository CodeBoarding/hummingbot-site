## Store your API keys securely

If someone gains access to your API keys, they can place trades on your behalf. They might execute trades at unfavorable rates or even trade into scam or low liquidity tokens causing significant losses. Unauthorized users can also access your trading history and other sensitive data.

* Recommendations:
    * Never share your API keys with anyone. Treat them as you would your password or private keys.
    * Do not store your API keys online or in easily accessible places. Use secure, offline methods whenever possible.
    * Always ensure that the permissions for withdrawals are turned OFF when generating API keys for trading bots.
    * Regularly review and rotate your API keys.
    * Use dedicated email accounts and strong, unique passwords for your exchange accounts.
    * Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your exchange accounts for an extra layer of security.
