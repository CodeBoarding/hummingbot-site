## Dashboard

To get to your liquidity miner dashboard, first navigate to [miner.hummingbot.io](https://miner.hummingbot.io) and log into your account, as you did in [step 2](2-configure-miner.md).

![go to dashboard][dashboard]

### Track Orders

In your dashboard, go to the `Order Tracking` tab.

Here you can see the orders you have placed in the past hour. You can display the order history by market pair, and view by the amount of the orders or the price at which they were placed.

You can also watch your orders being placed and cancelled on the exchanges themselves.

### See Rewards Earned

After some processing time, your earned rewards will be visible in the **Rewards** tab of the Miner page. The Rewards tab contains a chart that displays the rewards earned by your bot over time. You can click on each per-minute order book snapshot to drill down into the orders placed and rewards earned by your bot.

### Track Performance

Finally, you can visit the Performance tab in your Miner Dashboard. The Performance tab breaks down your total Profit & Loss (P&L) from trades filled, fees paid, and rewards earned across market pairs. See how your bots performed over the past hour, day, or week. Use this data to hone your strategies, and watch as your knowledge and profits grow!
